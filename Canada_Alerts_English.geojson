				"Summary" : "Description: ROAD DUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR VERNON\n\n(March 3, 2021 - Vernon) The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Interior Health has issued a Road Dust Advisory for Vernon because of high concentrations of coarse particulate matter that are expected to persist until there is precipitation, dust suppression or a change in traffic patterns. Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice. \n\nExposure is a concern for pregnant women, infants, and older adults, as well as, individuals with conditions such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, diabetes or respiratory infections such as COVID-19. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or  reduce  strenuous  exercise until the advisory is lifted. Where appropriate, maintain physical distancing. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Real-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at \n\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-03-06T15:06:08-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
