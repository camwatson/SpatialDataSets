We could see between 20 and 40 millimetres.\nSoutheasterly winds could gust from 70 to 90 kilometres per hour over the tip of the Gaspé Peninsula and the Lower North Shore on Monday.\n\nThe strong winds combined with the fact that we are currently in a period of high tidal ranges may produce breaking sea conditions at Gaspé-Percé, on Anticosti Island and on the Lower North Shore Monday afternoon.\n\nGiven the complexity of this system, it is still too early to determine the expected amounts of precipitation and the regions that will be the most affected.\n\nMore information on this system's development will be provided as it becomes available.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Significant snowfall is expected over some areas.\n\nTotal snowfall: 10 to 20 cm.\n\nLocations: mainly inland sections of eastern Newfoundland.\n\nTime span: This afternoon until Sunday morning.\n\nRemarks: The highest snowfall amounts can be expected inland and over higher terrain. Most coastal areas should see much lower snowfall amounts as the snow occasionally mixes with or changes to rain.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nSnowfall warnings are issued when significant snowfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
