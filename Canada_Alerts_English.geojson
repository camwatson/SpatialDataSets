				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from a forest fire near Sabbies River is causing a reduction in air quality due to smoke in its vicinity and areas downwind to the east and northeast.\n\nLocations: Sabbies River to Rogersville and vicinity. Satellite imagery this morning showed smoke stretching eastward over an area roughly between Richibucto and Miramichi all the way to the coast.\n\nShort range wind forecast: Southwesterly 20 to 40 km/h diminishing this evening. On Wednesday, winds are forecast to be 10 to 20 km/h and variable in direction. \n\nRemarks: The forest fire is still out of control this afternoon and is covering an estimated area of 350 hectares as reported by New Brunswick Natural resources and Energy Development. More information will be provided as it becomes available.\n\n###\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-05-27T14:59:16-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the New Brunswick Department of Environment and Local Government, the New Brunswick Department of Health, 2020-05-26T23:00:16-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1875191830.2020<br>Area: Stanley - Doaktown - Blackville Area, Kent County, Kouchibouguac National Park, Miramichi and area",
