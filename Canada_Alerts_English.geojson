				"Summary" : "Description: A disturbance developing along the foothills of Alberta is expected to move eastward and spread snow into southwestern Saskatchewan beginning  Friday night. The snow will persist on Saturday before gradually tapering off Saturday night or Sunday morning. Total snowfall accumulation of 10 to 25 cm are possible with the greatest amounts falling over the higher terrain of the Cypress Hills. In addition to the snow, gusty east to northeast winds will create poor visibilities in blowing snow especially on Saturday.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Poor weather conditions may contribute to transportation delays.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
