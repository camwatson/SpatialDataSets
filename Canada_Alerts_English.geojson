This is expected to bring blowing snow with poor visibility lasting for a few hours. The winds will then switch to the northwest and are expected to bring blizzard conditions with near zero visibility lasting until Friday morning. \n\nIn Baker Lake, winds are expected to rapidly increase to 50 km/h gusting to 70 on Thursday morning from the northwest. This combined with light snow will create blizzard conditions with poor visibility lasting until Friday morning. \n\nThis low will continue to push East and create further blowing snow events for Coral Harbour and Kinngait on Friday.\n\n###\n\nPoor weather conditions may contribute to transportation delays.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The highest amounts are expected along and south of the Highway 17 corridor.\n\nWhere: Southern portions of Algoma District including Sault Ste. Marie and Elliot Lake. This includes sections of the following highways: \n- Highway 17\n- Highway 129\n- Highway 108\n\nWhen: Through to early this afternoon. The heaviest snowfall is expected from 6:00 A.M. EST to 10:00 A.M. EST. \n\nActions: Motorists should allow extra time to reach their destination. If visibility is reduced while driving, slow down, watch for tail lights ahead and be prepared to stop.\n\nDiscussion: A potent Alberta Clipper will track across central Lake Huron today bringing heavy snow. Accumulating snow will cause poor driving conditions, and impact the commute this morning.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
