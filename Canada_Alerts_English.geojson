The snow will develop Wednesday morning and then begin to taper off in the evening over mainland Nova Scotia and overnight in Cape Breton. Current indications suggest total snowfall of 15 to 25 cm. Additionally, strong northerly winds will develop giving reduced visibility in blowing snow.\n\nHigher than normal water levels are expected at high tide Wednesday afternoon or evening along the Cape Breton coastline and the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult.
