The snow will change to ice pellets this evening and possibly freezing rain overnight, before tapering off as rain showers before morning.  \n\nIn addition, strong easterly winds gusting to 70 km/h will cause reduced visibilities in blowing snow, especially prior to the ice pellets.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nSnowfall warnings are issued when significant snowfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
