				"Summary" : "Description: Snow with a chance of rain over the south beginning on Wednesday\n\nA low pressure system developing over the American Southwest will move through the New England States on Wednesday before lying over the Gulf of St. Lawrence on Friday.\n\nIt is still too early to determine exactly what will be the weather associated with this vigorous system. However, the storm is expected to cause a mixed bag of precipitation and strong winds. For now, north of the river, colder temperatures will likely bring snow, while the precipitation in the south will likely turn to rain with a short period of freezing rain during the changeover.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts will vary depending on how the system's track evolves, but it should exceed 15 centimetres over several areas north of the river and over the tip of the Gaspé Peninsula.\n\nSubsequent weather statements will provide more information as the low pressure system's track becomes more certain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow with a chance of rain over the south beginning on Wednesday\n\nA low pressure system developing over the American Southwest will move through the New England States on Wednesday before lying over the Gulf of St. Lawrence on Friday.\n\nIt is still too early to determine exactly what will be the weather associated with this vigorous system. However, the storm is expected to cause a mixed bag of precipitation and strong winds. For now, north of the river, colder temperatures will likely bring snow, while the precipitation in the south will likely turn to rain with a short period of freezing rain during the changeover.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts will vary depending on how the system's track evolves, but it should exceed 15 centimetres over several areas north of the river and over the tip of the Gaspé Peninsula.\n\nSubsequent weather statements will provide more information as the low pressure system's track becomes more certain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow with a chance of a mixed bag of precipitation over the south beginning on Wednesday\n\nA low pressure system developing over the American Southwest will move through the New England States on Wednesday before lying over the Gulf of St. Lawrence on Friday.\n\nIt is still too early to determine exactly what will be the weather associated with this vigorous system. However, the projected trend suggests that this storm will cause a mixed bag of precipitation accompanied by strong winds. For now, north of the river, colder temperatures will likely favor snow, while in the south precipitation will likely turn to rain with a short period of freezing rain during the changeover.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts will vary depending on the evolution of the system's trajectory, but may exceed 15 centimetres over several areas north of the river and over the tip of the Gaspésie Peninsula.\n\nFuture weather statements will provide more details as the low pressure system's track and, as a result, precipitation types and amounts, become more certain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.
