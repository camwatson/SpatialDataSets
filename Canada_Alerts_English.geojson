Intense flurries and strong winds are expected with this front, giving momentarily near zero visibilities under the snow and in the blowing snow. Moreover, rapidly falling temperatures are on tap behind the cold front, which could make some roads icy and slippery.

				"Summary" : "Description: A period of heavy snow may affect the morning commute on Wednesday.\n\nTotal snowfall: 10 to 15 cm.\n\nLocations: All of Nova Scotia except for the South Shore and the western half of the Annapolis Valley.\n\nTime span: overnight into Wednesday morning.\n\nRemarks: A disturbance tracking south of the province will spread periods of snow to the province later today, changing to or mixing with rain over southwestern sections of the province this evening before tapering to a chance of flurries in most areas late this evening.  As this system begins to pull away from the region late tonight, a swath of heavy snow is expected to develop across much of the province overnight, potentially giving snowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm in just a few hours before the snow ends on Wednesday morning. These snowfall rates and rapidly accumulating snow could have impacts on the morning commute in many parts of the province early Wednesday morning.\n\nIn addition, recent forecast guidance indicates that another system will bring more snow to most of the province on Thursday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.
