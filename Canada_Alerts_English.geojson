				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls possible tonight. \n\nSnow currently over the area is expected to transition to snow squalls this evening into tonight. At this point in time, the heavy squalls are likely to impact areas just north of London and Woodstock.  A Snow Squall Warning is likely by this evening as these squalls develop.  Any snow squalls that form will last into Saturday morning before shifting northward during the day. \n\nThrough this same period of time, winds are forecast to gust up to 60 km/h resulting in local blowing snow in the snow squalls, particularly over exposed areas.\n\nHazards: \nLocally 5 to 15 cm of snow by Saturday evening.\nQuickly accumulating snow at times.\nPoor visibility in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nImpacts: \nHazardous travel tonight into Saturday.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

This system will also bring 10 to 20 cm of snow. These winds combined with the falling snow will lead to significantly reduced visibilities in blowing snow, creating near blizzard conditions for Iqaluit. \n\nConditions will gradually improve Sunday evening.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

In addition, bands of lake effect snow will result in snow becoming heavy at times. Locally reduced visibilities and quickly accumulating snow on roadways are likely within these lake effect snow bands.\n\nLocal amounts of 5 to 15 cm are possible by Saturday morning.\n\nMotorists are advised to exercise caution as roads may become slippery due to the freshly fallen snow.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The snow squall will be particularly intense overnight and into early Saturday morning. The snow squall is expected to shift southward into New York State on Saturday morning. Wind gusts of 60 to 70 km/h will result in local blowing snow over exposed areas.\n\nHazards: \nLocally 5 to 15 cm of snow by Saturday morning.\nQuickly accumulating snow of up to 5 cm per hour at times.\nPoor visibility in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nImpacts: \nHazardous travel, particularly along portions of Highway 401.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.
