The greatest chance of freezing precipitation is in the Fort Liard Region. The freezing rain is forecast to begin tonight in Fort Liard and will progress eastwards throughout Sunday morning.

Travel will be hazardous along these routes due to accumulating snow and reduced visibility in blowing snow.  Along the coast, especially from Norman Bay to Lodge Bay, temperatures will be near zero, which may cause the snow to mix with or change over to rain on Monday.

In addition, strong winds gusting to 60 or 70 km/h will accompanying this system will greatly reduce visibilities in blowing snow.\n\nOver the Southeastern Gaspe Peninsula, mixed precipitation are expected.
