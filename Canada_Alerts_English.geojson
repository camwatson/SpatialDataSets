Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted.  Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at  https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-03-21T14:33:48-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

The frozen ground has a reduced ability to absorb this rainfall.\n\nLocations: southern and western Newfoundland.\n\nTotal snowfall: generally 2 to 4 cm.\n\nTotal rainfall: 30 to 60 mm in the south and 15 to 25 mm in the west. \n\nTime span: until overnight tonight in the west and southwest, and tonight in the south.\n\nRemarks:  Rain at times heavy in the southwest will spread elsewhere this evening. Conditions will improve by Saturday morning. \n\nStrong southerly winds and mild temperatures will accompany the rainfall to cause significant snowmelt and runoff, leading to potential flooding.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
