				"Summary" : "Description: Winter storm Monday.\n\nOccasional light snow or ice pellets are expected Sunday night. However, heavier precipitation is then forecast to arrive Monday morning and continue into Monday evening before transitioning to snow Monday night.\n\nThere is considerable uncertainty as to the type of the heavier precipitation Monday. At this time freezing rain seems more likely, however there are some indications that ice pellets could be the primary type of precipitation.\n\nTravel is expected to be very poor Monday. If the precipitation falls mainly as freezing rain there is the potential for an ice storm, resulting in significant ice accumulation and widespread power outages. \n\nEnvironment Canada will continue to closely monitor this developing situation.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Snowfall amounts could approach 15 centimetres. Moreover, strong easterly winds could produce blowing snow locally. Precipitation could also fall as freezing rain at times Monday, especially over areas near the border of Ontario.\n\nAs the exact track of this low could change, the types and amounts of precipitation could be subject to change.\n\nWith this poor weather, road conditions should deteriorate.
