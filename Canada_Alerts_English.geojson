				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions will be favourable for the development of funnel clouds today.\n\n\n###\n\nThese types of funnel clouds are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nIf conditions become more favourable for the development of landspout tornadoes, watches and warnings will be issued by Environment Canada.\n\nLandspout tornadoes do not usually cause significant damage but can still be dangerous. They can be strong enough to topple trees, damage roofs or toss debris short distances.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-06-11T04:54:41-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-10T21:18:41-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1572962252.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Wallace-Woodworth incl.

This line may reach the shoreline of Lake Huron between 4.00 and 5.00 PM. \n\nLocations impacted include:\nKincardine, Port Elgin, Point Clark, Inverhuron Provincial Park, MacGregor Point Provincial Park, Southampton, Inverhuron and Tiverton.\n\nWind gusts of 100 km/h, and torrential downpours suddenly reducing visibility to near zero are possible.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops.
