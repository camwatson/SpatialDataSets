				"Summary" : "Description: For Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThe next information statement will be issued by 03:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nHurricane Dorian is expected to severely impact parts of the Atlantic provinces this weekend. \n\n1. Summary of basic information at 09:00 a.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: 32.2 North 79.4 West.\n\nAbout 95 kilometres southeast of Charleston.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 185 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: northerly at 11 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 957 millibars.\n\n\n2. Public weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nBased on the latest forecast guidance, the most likely track projection brings Hurricane Dorian south of the Maritimes on Saturday, pushing through eastern Nova Scotia late in the day, and then over western Newfoundland by Sunday morning. Severe winds and rainfall will have major impacts for southeastern New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Western Newfoundland, and the Quebec Lower North Shore. There will also be large waves, especially for the Atlantic coasts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and eastern portions of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Finally, there is a chance that storm surge may affect parts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.\n\na. Wind.\n\nMost regions will experience some tropical storm force winds. Near and to the south of the forecast track, winds should reach hurricane force. As the storm moves across Nova Scotia, there is a possibility of hurricane force northwesterlies behind it. Wind impacts will likely be enhanced by foliage on the trees, enhancing\ntree damage and tree falls, and potentially causing power outages. \n\nb. Rainfall.\n\nRainfall will be significant, especially north and west of Dorian's track, where heavy rainfall could lead to flooding. The highest rainfall amounts are likely for Nova Scotia and the Gulf of St. Lawrence region. Forecast guidance is suggesting widespread amounts in excess of 50 mm, but north and west of Dorian, a swath of more than 100 mm is likely. Some districts have received large quantities of rain from Post-tropical Storm Erin last week, and with the soil moisture still very high from Erin, excessive runoff may exacerbate the flooding potential.    \n\nc. Surge/Waves.\n\nThere will also be some rough and pounding surf, especially for parts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Large waves will reach the Southwestern Shore of Nova Scotia on Saturday and build to near 10 metres over the Eastern Shore Saturday night. These waves will likely reach southern Newfoundland by Sunday morning. Waves near or higher than 5 metres will impact north facing coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Note that waves will break higher along some of the coastlines, and dangerous rip currents are likely. Please exercise extreme caution. Storm surge is possible, mainly for parts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland, but it is too early to be specific about significant impacts, if any.\n\n3. Marine weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nAs Hurricane Dorian moves into our waters, there is a good chance of hurricane force southeasterlies near and south of the track, mainly over southern Atlantic forecast waters. As the storm moves into the Maritimes, storm to hurricane force northwesterlies will likely develop behind it. Waves in excess of 12 metres are likely south of the storm track, beginning late Saturday over southwestern waters and approaching southern Newfoundland Sunday morning. \n\nForecasters: McArthur, Mercer, Couturier\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-09-06T17:35:14-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-09-05T11:36:14-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1310978942.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Fredericton and Southern York County, Oromocto and Sunbury County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Stanley - Doaktown - Blackville Area, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Kouchibouguac National Park, Fundy National Park, Miramichi and area, Acadian Peninsula, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I., Avalon Peninsula North, Avalon Peninsula Southeast, St. John's and vicinity, Avalon Peninsula Southwest, Burin Peninsula, Connaigre, Burgeo - Ramea, Channel-Port aux Basques and vicinity, Corner Brook and vicinity, Deer Lake - Humber Valley, Gros Morne, Bay St. George, Buchans and the interior, Grand Falls-Windsor and vicinity, Bay of Exploits, Bonavista North, Bonavista Peninsula, Clarenville and vicinity, Gander and vicinity, Green Bay - White Bay, Terra Nova, Northern Peninsula East, Parson's Pond - Hawke's Bay, Port Saunders and the Straits, Red Bay to L'Anse-au-Clair, Norman Bay to Lodge Bay, Cartwright to Black Tickle, Eagle River, Chevery, Blanc-Sablon, Anticosti, Îles-de-la-Madeleine",
