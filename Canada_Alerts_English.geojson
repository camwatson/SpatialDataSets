				"Summary" : "Description: Periods of snow are expected tonight through Monday morning, with the potential for significant snowfall Sunday night.\n\nThe first round of snow is expected to be fairly light. Snow will begin tonight with just trace amounts by Sunday morning. During the day Sunday, a few centimetres are expected, however, the snow will be wet and may become mixed with rain Sunday afternoon as temperatures rise above freezing.\n\nA more significant round of snow is possible beginning late Sunday. Current guidance suggests snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 cm Sunday night through Monday.\n\nHowever, with temperatures hovering near freezing the snow will be wet and slushy. If it is slightly warmer than expected, snow is likely to change over to rain.\n\nWhile there is still some uncertainty in the forecast, wet and slushy snow may make for a messy commute Monday morning. Power outages are also possible if heavy, wet snow accumulates on trees.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total accumulation of 5 to 15 cm across B.C. south coast from tonight to Sunday afternoon.\n\nA cool airmass associated with a low pressure system will bring snow or rain beginning this evening on Vancouver Island and the Sunshine Coast and late this evening or midnight for the Lower Mainland and Malahat Highway.\n\nThe mixed precipitation will change to snow by early Sunday morning as precipitation rates increase.\n\nThe complex terrain around the south coast will result in varied snowfall totals across the region. Communities immediately near the water such as Comox, Parksville, Nanaimo and downtown Vancouver will see up to 5 cm of snow. Higher elevations and inland sections of Metro Vancouver, Fraser Valley - West, Vancouver Island and Sunshine Coast will see higher accumulations.\n\nAt this time, elevations near 300 metres of Metro Vancouver could see up to 10 cm of snow. Inland and higher elevations of East Vancouver Island - Campbell River to Courtenay could see 10 to 15 cm.\n\nThe Malahat Highway will see 10 cm of snow between tonight and Sunday afternoon.\n\nSnow will change to rain or become mixed with rain late Sunday afternoon.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
