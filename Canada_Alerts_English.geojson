The highest amounts are expected to be between Mary's Harbour and Red Bay. Those travelling between communities should be on the lookout for localized flooding, minor washouts from runoff, and water pooling, especially in areas with higher existing snowpack. Some areas further inland and over higher elevations may also experience accumulating wet snow tonight and Tuesday morning.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
