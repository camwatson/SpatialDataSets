Smoke is expected or occurring.\n\nLocation: West Porters Lake near exit 19 of Highway 107\t\n\nAn active forest fire near Highway 107 exit 19 is producing smoke and reduced air quality near the surface. Light westerly winds this morning will increase to southwest 20 km/h this afternoon and will likely cause the smoke plume to drift later in the day.\n\nHighway 107 remains closed between exits 18 and 20 and an Evacuation Comfort Centre has been established at the Lake Echo Community Centre for those in need of assistance.\n\n###\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-05-24T22:59:08-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness, 2020-05-24T13:52:08-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0937549368.2020<br>Area: Halifax Metro and Halifax County West",
