However, areas slightly inland are still likely to reach heat warning criteria over the next few days. \n\nTemperatures across the province are expected to cool off somewhat beginning Wednesday evening as a trough of low pressure begins to move across the region.\n\n###\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
