The system is sliding down from the northwest so there will be little warming of the cool airmass in place over Vancouver Island.  \n\nAs a result, precipitation will fall as snow over inland Vancouver Island beginning this evening.  Most communities will receive 5 to 10 cm of accumulation by mid-morning Friday. But higher elevation passes like Sutton Pass and Port Alberni Summit may get 15 cm or more total accumulation. \n\nPrecipitation will change to rain by mid to late Friday morning.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Temperatures are expected to drop to below the freezing mark on Saturday, changing the rain into freezing rain. Several hours of freezing rain may occur until temperatures climb to above freezing again on Sunday. This scenario is expected to result in significant ice accretion over these regions. \n\nStrong southwest winds gusting to 70 km/h are also expected Sunday morning, with the highest gusts occurring along the shores of Lake Huron. Strong winds coupled with ice build-up on tree branches and power lines could cause power outages in the hardest hit areas.\n\nRainfall amounts may reach up to 25 mm, although there remains considerable uncertainty at this time. Warnings will be issued as the event draws nearer.\n\nTravel will be impacted throughout Southern Ontario Saturday into Sunday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The system is sliding down from the northwest so there will be little warming of the cool airmass in place over the Lower Mainland. \n\n As a result, precipitation will fall mostly as snow over Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley, Snow will begin late this evening and continue until late morning, or midday Friday. \n\nTotal amounts will be highly dependent on elevation and proximity to the water. The highest amounts will be over the North Shore and the northeast sector of Metro Vancouver. The higher elevations of West and North Vancouver, Coquitlam, Port Moody, Surrey and Maple Ridge will get 15 to 25 cm accumulation by late morning. \n\nThe City of Vancouver and Burnaby will receive 10 to 15 cm total. \n\nAt low elevations and near the Straight Georgia ( for example, Richmond) accumulations will likely be up to 5 cm.  \n\nThe Fraser Valley will see 10 to 15 cm total accumulation by midday Friday. The higher end of the range will occur north of the Fraser River.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A significant period of freezing precipitation is forecast for the province of Quebec for Saturday and Sunday.\n\nPrecipitation will begin on Saturday as rain over Southern Quebec and is expected to change over to freezing rain Saturday evening. Freezing precipitation amounts could be significant and make surfaces such as roads, streets and sidewalks slippery and hazardous. Strong gusts of 60-70 km/h are also expected on Sunday, and may possibly impact ice-covered structures such as tree limbs and power lines.\n\nThe Outaouais, the Laurentians and Lanaudière regions could also see some snow and ice pellets beginning Saturday afternoon.\n\nThere is still some uncertainty regarding the track of this system, which may affect total rainfall and freezing precipitation amounts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Snow will begin late this evening and continue until midday Friday. \n\nTotal amounts of 15 to 25 cm are forecast by midday Friday before the snow eases and becomes mixed with rain.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
