The combination of wind gusting to 60 km/h and snow will result in lowered visibility in blowing snow.\n\nThe snow squalls are expected to move north of the region once again late Saturday afternoon.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.

Reduced visibilities are expected as a result. \n\nSnowfall accumulations will not be overly significant, with a total of 10 to 15 cm forecast by Saturday afternoon.\n\nBlowing snow is expected to continue into late Saturday when wind will begin to ease.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nBlowing snow advisories are issued when winds are expected to create blowing snow giving poor visibility to 800 metres or less for at least 3 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nSnow squalls will persist this evening and continue through to Saturday morning. \n\nLocal snowfall accumulations of 10 to 15 cm are expected in these snow squalls.\n \nThe combination of strong and gusty winds reaching up to 60 km/h and heavy snow at times will result in a significant reduction in visibility in local blowing snow.\n\n###\n\nVisibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nSnow squall warnings are issued when bands of snow form that produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A period of very cold wind chills is expected.\n\nAn arctic ridge of high pressure has allowed for a very cold air mass from the north to sink over southern Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba.\n\nAlong with winds of 10 to 20 km/h, extreme wind chill values of -40 or colder will spread across southern regions of the prairies tonight. Some areas may rebound slightly from these bitterly cold values Saturday afternoon but extreme cold warnings will likely remain in place for Saturday night into Sunday morning as well. \n\nThese bitterly cold values will remain in the prairies into next week.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nFor more information on cold and your health, visit Manitoba Health at https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/cold.html or call Health Links - Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
