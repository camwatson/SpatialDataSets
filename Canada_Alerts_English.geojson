In the Calgary, Brooks, Lethbridge, Medicine Hat, Okotoks, and Cypress Hills areas temperatures will start out well above freezing with widely scattered showers. However the cold front with this system will bring gusty northerly winds to 80 km/h and a sharp drop in temperatures. The front may also bring heavier pockets of snow and blowing snow as well. This abrupt change in weather will lead to hazardous travel conditions, and may occur during the Friday afternoon commute.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A low pressure system will track across southwestern Saskatchewan today bringing accumulating snow to areas south of a line from roughly Kindersley to Oxbow. The snow will move into western regions this morning, central areas this afternoon, and eastern areas this evening. In some places the precipitation may initially be mixed with rain, but for the most part it will fall as snow - except in the extreme southwest corner of the province where more of a mixture is expected. \n\nTotal snowfall accumulations will be in the 5 to 10 cm range in a number of areas. Current indications are that the highest amounts will fall from about Piapot through Shaunavon to Rockglen as well as along the northern slopes of the Cypress Hills. \n\nThe system will track quickly out of the region tonight, but before departing will bring strong gusty northerly winds to the southwest corner of the province during the evening. By Saturday a much cooler air mass will be over the area with temperatures well below seasonal values.\n\nPlease be aware that roads may become slippery along with reduced visibility at times.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls may develop late this morning and into this afternoon along an intense cold front moving southward across southern Alberta. This cold front is expected to produce brief periods of intense snowfall and reduced visibilities. \n\nThe risk for snow squalls will diminish early this evening as the front pushes into Montana.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ABstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ABStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-10-17T01:59:59-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-10-16T10:27:59-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1053685426.2020<br>Area: Mountain View Co. near Sundre, Mountain View Co. near Olds and Didsbury, Mountain View Co. near Cremona and Water Valley, Mountain View Co. near Carstairs and Stirlingville, Rocky View Co. near Airdrie and Crossfield, Rocky View Co. near Bottrel and Madden, Rocky View Co. near Cochrane, Kneehill Co. near Torrington and Wimborne, Kneehill Co. near Trochu and Huxley, Kneehill Co. near Three Hills, Kneehill Co. near Acme and Linden, Kneehill Co. near Carbon, Starland Co. near Rumsey and Rowley, Starland Co. near Morrin and Munson, Starland Co. near Michichi and Delia, Wheatland Co. near Rockyford and Rosebud, Wheatland Co. near Hwys 569 and 848, Town of Drumheller, Rocky View Co. near Irricana Beiseker and Kathyrn, S.A. 2 near Finnegan and Little Fish Lake Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Strong winds that may cause damage are expected or occurring.\n\nAn approaching low pressure system is expected to generate strong westerly winds this morning across southern Alberta, with gusts as high as 90 km/h possible.\n\nAs the low pressure system moves southward towards the Canadian-U.S. border, a cold front will usher in strong northerly winds gusting to 90 km/h throughout the afternoon hours. Winds should ease by this evening.\n\n###\n\nDamage to buildings, such as to roof shingles and windows, may occur. High winds may toss loose objects or cause tree branches to break.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
