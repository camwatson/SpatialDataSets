				"Summary" : "Description: A low pressure system from Montana will track through southern Saskatchewan today.\n\nThis weather system is bringing wintery weather through much of southwestern Saskatchewan. A swath of heavy snow will push through the region giving a quick snowfall accumulation of 10 to 15 cm. Visibilities will be very low in the falling snow and travel will be affected. \n\nEven though heavy snowfall accumulations are not forecast for regions towards the Alberta border, there will be periods of very low visibilities in falling snow this morning. \n\nThe weather system will move through the northeastern grainbelt this afternoon bringing with it the heavy snow. At the same the heavy snowfall will be weakening in more western areas. The heavy snowfall will push entirely out of Saskatchewan and into Manitoba this evening.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
