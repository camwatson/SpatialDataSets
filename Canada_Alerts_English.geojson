Overnight lows will remain in the low to mid twenties, offering little relief from the heat. \n\nWednesday may be slightly cooler and not reach Heat Warning criteria, however the stretch of days before and after will attain Heat Warning criteria. A cooler air mass may arrive by next Sunday.\n\n###\n\nExtreme heat affects everyone.\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nWatch for the effects of heat illness: swelling, rash, cramps, fainting, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and the worsening of some health conditions.\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-07-15T18:27:39-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-15T02:28:39-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.4221295700.2019<br>Area: Chatham-Kent - Rondeau Park, Windsor - Leamington - Essex County",

Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to NSstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #NSStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-07-15T05:02:33-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-14T23:45:33-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2118141069.2019<br>Area: Îles-de-la-Madeleine",
