				"Summary" : "Description: A series of vigorous frontal systems will move across the south coast of BC  today through Saturday. They will bring periods of heavy rain and strong winds in the first active storm cycle of the the fall season.\n\nThe first system will spread rain to Vancouver Island and the mainland today and Thursday. \n\nRainfall intensity will vary through the day and across regions. Over Vancouver Island, total rainfall amounts over the two day period will generally range from 15 to 40 mm, with amounts in excess of 100 mm over West Vancouver Island. For the mainland coast, total rainfall amounts will range from 30 mm to over 50 mm for the two day period. The heaviest rainfall amounts are currently expected near the mountains.\n\nThis system will also bring strong southeast winds to the west coast of Vancouver Island early this morning. Strong winds over the Strait of Georgia and surrounding regions will peak early this morning. Winds will diminish later today, but gusty conditions will continue.\n\nTonight and Thursday, unsettled conditions will bring a risk of thunderstorms across the region as well.\n\nThe combination of heavy rain with leaves on the ground may lead to localized flooding. Strong winds may also lead to power outages.\n\nThe wet pattern will continue with more rain expected Friday and Saturday.\n\nRainfall and wind warnings are now in effect for some regions, and will be updated as needed.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A series of vigorous frontal systems will move across the south coast of BC  today through Saturday. They will bring periods of heavy rain and strong winds in the first active storm cycle of the the fall season.\n\nThe first system will spread rain to Vancouver Island and the mainland today and Thursday. \n\nRainfall intensity will vary through the day and across regions. Over Vancouver Island, total rainfall amounts over the two day period will generally range from 15 to 40 mm, with amounts in excess of 100 mm over West Vancouver Island. For the mainland coast, total rainfall amounts will range from 30 mm to over 50 mm for the two day period. The heaviest rainfall amounts are currently expected near the mountains.\n\nThis system will also bring strong southeast winds to the west coast of Vancouver Island early this morning. Strong winds over the Strait of Georgia and surrounding regions will peak early this morning. Winds will diminish later today, but gusty conditions will continue.\n\nTonight and Thursday, unsettled conditions will bring a risk of thunderstorms across the region as well.\n\nThe combination of heavy rain with leaves on the ground may lead to localized flooding. Strong winds may also lead to power outages.\n\nThe wet pattern will continue with more rain expected Friday and Saturday.\n\nRainfall and wind warnings are now in effect for some regions, and will be updated as needed.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: For Post-tropical Storm Teddy.\n\nThe next intermediate information statement will be issued by 12:00 P.M. ADT, followed by the next full information statement at 3:00 P.M.\n\nPost-Tropical Storm Teddy continues to bring heavy rain, strong winds and heavy pounding surf to eastern Nova Scotia and southern Newfoundland today. The centre of Teddy is expected to make landfall along the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia in the next hour or so.\n\n1. Summary of basic information at 9:00 A.M. ADT.\n\nLocation: near 44.9 North 62.4 West.\n\nAbout 91 kilometres east-northeast of Halifax.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 110 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: northeast at 37 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 960 millibars.\n\nTeddy remains a powerful post-tropical storm on its approach towards eastern Nova Scotia this morning. It will continue to weaken as it travels across eastern Nova Scotia and into the southeastern Gulf of St. Lawrence this afternoon. The storm will then continue to weaken further as it moves across the eastern Gulf of St. Lawrence later this afternoon and towards northern Newfoundland tonight.\n\n\n2. Public impacts and warnings summary: \n\na. Wind.\nWind and Tropical Storm warnings are in effect for the Atlantic coastline of Nova Scotia from Halifax to Cape Breton, where wind gusts of 80 to 110 km/h are occurring or expected into this afternoon. A Tropical Storm warning is in effect for the southwest coast of Newfoundland with wind gusts of 80 to 100 km/h possible into this afternoon. Tropical storm watches remain in effect for northern Nova Scotia, as well as Prince Edward Island and Iles de la Madeleine where winds gusting 70 to 80 possibly reaching 90 km/h are possible this afternoon. Given trees are still in full leaf, these winds could cause limbs to break with some tree falls, likely leading to many power outages. A Wreckhouse wind warning remains in effect for southwestern Newfoundland where winds could gust up to 130 km/h into this evening.\n\nb. Rainfall.\nRainfall warnings are in effect for all of Nova Scotia except westernmost regions. Rainfall warnings are also in effect for Prince Edward Island, Les Iles de la Madeleine and parts of the south coast of Newfoundland. Rain, at times heavy, will continue for these areas today as Teddy makes landfall and continues northeast toward Newfoundland. Rainfall amounts generally of 50 to 80 mm have already fallen since yesterday, with the exception of Victoria county in Cape Breton where 100 to 130 mm have fallen. With additional rainfall today, the total rainfall expected remains at 50 to 100 mm, with upwards of 150 mm possible for Victoria county.\n\nc. Surge/Waves.\nStorm surge warnings are in effect along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia from Halifax - East of Porters Lake through to eastern Cape Breton County, as well as the southwestern coast of Newfoundland. Large swells will continue to effect the Atlantic coast this morning with waves of up to 8 to 10 metres possible, and will break higher along parts of the coast. \n\nElevated water levels and large waves are occurring along eastern parts of the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia this morning and will continue to develop over southwestern Newfoundland into this afternoon. There is also a chance for Prince Edward Island and Iles de la Madeleine today when winds increase out of the northwest behind the system. \n\nThe highest risk is the combination of the very large waves combining with the storm surge to cause dangerous conditions along the Atlantic coasts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Rough and pounding surf, localised flooding and coastal infrastructure damage and erosion are likely in vulnerable areas, even outside of the times of high tide.\n\n3. Marine impacts and warning summary:\n\nStorm warnings remain for most waters south of Nova Scotia.  Gale warnings are in effect for most Gulf of St. Lawrence waters as well as the southwestern Grand Banks. Teddy will continue to produce waves of 8 to 10 metres east of the storms track into through Fourchu and possibly reaching the southwest coast of Newfoundland. In addition, High Water Level warnings continue to be in effect for Eastern Shore, Fourchu and the Southwest Coast.\n\nBoth marine buoys B44150 and B44137 saw significant wave heights of 11 metres with B44137 reaching a peak wave height of 25 metres in the overnight period. \n\nForecaster(s): McArthur/Mercer/March\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-09-24T04:59:55-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-09-23T11:37:55-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2911336877.2020<br>Area: Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I., Burin Peninsula, Connaigre, Burgeo - Ramea, Channel-Port aux Basques and vicinity, Îles-de-la-Madeleine",
