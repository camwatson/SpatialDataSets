				"Summary" : "Description: Accumulating snow most likely overnight and tomorrow morning then again Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nTotal snowfall: from a few cm to 15 cm or more over both days\n\nMaximum wind gusts: 50 to 60 km/h possibly higher.\n\nLocations: from the valley into central, northern, and eastern Nova Scotia as well as southern half of Cape Breton Island. Higher elevations in these areas most at risk for highest snow amounts.\n\nTime span: First round of wintry weather expected late overnight tonight into Monday morning. Second round Monday night and continuing into Tuesday.\n\nRemarks: A slow moving weather system is expected to stall south of Nova Scotia on Monday and Tuesday and bring periods of rain and snow to the province both days. At this time northern and eastern parts of the province are most at risk for receiving accumulating snow, especially over higher elevations. Given the time of year and fact that temperatures will be a degree or two above zero for most of the event, the snow will likely be heavy and wet, with accumulations likely varying significantly over short distances.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Higher elevations in these areas most at risk for highest snow amounts.\n\nTime span: First round of wintry weather expected late overnight tonight into Monday morning. Second round Monday night and continuing into Tuesday.\n\nRemarks: A slow-moving weather system is expected to stall south of Nova Scotia on Monday and Tuesday and bring periods of rain and snow to the province both days. At this time northern and eastern parts of the province are most at risk for receiving accumulating snow, especially over higher elevations. Given the time of year and fact that temperatures will be a degree or two above zero for most of the event, the snow will likely be heavy and wet, with accumulations likely varying significantly over short distances.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
