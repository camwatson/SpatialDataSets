				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA Pacific frontal system will move into the northern BC interior Friday morning. This system will be followed by an Arctic front pushing through the region Friday afternoon and then stalling over the region on Saturday. \n\nLong periods of snow are expected with total snowfall amounts of 30 to 40 cm forecast by Saturday evening. The heaviest snowfall is expected on Friday night and Saturday. Gusty winds behind the Arctic front may also give reduced visibilities in blowing snow starting Friday night. The snow will taper to flurries on Saturday evening.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-11-08T22:23:06-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-11-08T06:24:06-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3673517168.2019<br>Area: Highway 97 - Pine Pass",

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls are expected to develop. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nLater this afternoon, cold arctic air moving over Great Slave Lake will create favourable conditions for snow squalls to develop. Snow squalls are likely to persist until Saturday morning. Local snowfall accumulations of 10 to 20 cm are possible.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
