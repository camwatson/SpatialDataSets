				"Summary" : "Description: Rain, at times heavy, is expected.\n\nHeavy rain is expected for the inland sections of the central coast, the Sunshine Coast and Howe Sound. \n\nAn atmospheric river aimed at North Vancouver Island and the Central Coast will move southward tonight and Sunday morning. Rain will ease by Sunday morning and total rainfall amounts of 50 to 70 mm are expected.\n\nGiven the tropical origin of the atmospheric river, freezing levels will be on the rise, reaching near 3000 metres for the South Coast and close to 2500 metres for the North Coast. The mild air will result in rain at almost all elevations and steady temperatures overnight. High runoff and rising river levels are likely through the weekend.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-11-18T00:04:26-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-11-17T08:05:26-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3947964334.2019<br>Area: Central Coast - inland sections, Sunshine Coast - Gibsons to Earls Cove, Sunshine Coast - Saltery Bay to Powell River, Howe Sound",
