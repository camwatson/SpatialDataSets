Winds will increase throughout the day and will become severe by evening. Wind gusts up to 150 km/h are likely, especially along coastal areas.\n\nFlooding is also possible along parts of the coast due to storm surge and rough pounding surf later today.\n\n###\n\nThese winds will topple many trees leading to downed utility lines and extended service outages. Moderate to significant damage to roofing materials, exterior cladding and light structures is likely. This could result in some damage to docks and breakwaters. Shoreline erosion and wave overwash is expected where winds blow onshore.\n\nA hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected over parts of the region within 24 hours. Hurricane conditions include (A) sustained winds near 120 km/h or more, and/or (B) significantly elevated water levels and dangerous surf along the coast.\n\nBy nature, a hurricane also implies the threat of local flooding from heavy rainfall - consult your local area forecast for possible rainfall warnings.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Winds will increase late this evening and will become severe overnight and Sunday morning. Wind gusts up to 110 km/h are expected, especially along coastal areas.\n\n###\n\nThis could result in some damage to docks and breakwaters. Shoreline erosion and wave overwash is expected where winds blow onshore.\n\nA tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds near 65 km/h or more) are expected over parts of the region within 24 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Tropical storm force winds of 60 gusting to 90 km/h over exposed areas from Hurricane Dorian can be expected over the above regions.\n\nTropical storm conditions are expected to develop late this morning into early this afternoon as Hurricane Dorian quickly approaches the region.\n\nDorian will make landfall near Halifax this evening then move into the eastern Gulf of St. Lawrence on Sunday as a powerful post-tropical storm. Severe winds associated with Dorian will gust up between 90 to 120 km/h this afternoon and tonight.\n\n###\n\nThese winds could break tree branches potentially resulting in downed utility lines.\n\nA tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds near 65 km/h or more) are expected over parts of the region within 24 hours.\n\nBy nature, a tropical storm also implies the threat of local flooding from heavy rainfall - consult your local area forecast for possible rainfall warnings.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: For Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThe next intermediate statement will be issued at 12:00 p.m. ADT.\nFollowed by the full information statement issued at 03:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nThe outer rain bands of Hurricane Dorian are now affecting the southern maritimes as it continues to accelerate toward Nova Scotia, making landfall this evening near Halifax. Severe winds and heavy rain are in store for parts of Atlantic Canada and eastern Quebec.\n\n1. Summary of basic information at 09:00 a.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: 40.7 North 66.4 West.\n\nAbout: 542 kilometres southwest of Halifax.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 148 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: northeast at 41 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 961 millibars.\n\n\n2. Public weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nHurricane warnings are in effect for the south shore, central and eastern Nova Scotia and western Newfoundland. Hurricane Watches are in effect for eastern Prince Edward Island, and the Magdalen Islands. \n\nTropical storm warnings are in effect for southeastern New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, western and northern Nova Scotia, parts of northern and southwestern Newfoundland, the Magdalen Islands and parts of Quebec's Lower North Shore. \n\nThe latest forecast guidance shows the track of Hurricane Dorian approaching Nova Scotia this morning, passing near Halifax this evening, east of Prince Edward Island around midnight, and then over the eastern Gulf of St. Lawrence waters or western Newfoundland by Sunday morning. \n\nSevere winds and torrential rain will have major impacts for southeastern New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Western Newfoundland, the Magdalen Islands and the Quebec's Lower North Shore. Large waves are expected for the Atlantic coasts of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and for eastern portions of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Finally, storm surge, combined with large waves and pounding surf, may give flooding for parts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, the Magdalen Islands, and parts of the Quebec's Lower North Shore.\n\na. Wind.\n\nMost regions will experience tropical storm force winds of 90 to 110 km/h, beginning over southwestern Nova Scotia this morning, in the afternoon over eastern Nova Scotia, and towards evening for Prince Edward Island, the Magdalen Islands, and southwestern Newfoundland. Near and to the south of the forecast track, winds will reach hurricane force of 120 km/h or more. Behind the storm, winds will reach hurricane force northwesterlies. Wind impacts will likely be enhanced by foliage on the trees, causing broken branches and tree falls, resulting in power outages, blocking of roads, and other type of damages. \n\nHurricane force wind warnings are in effect for the south shore, central and eastern Nova Scotia, and a hurricane watch is in effect for eastern Prince Edward Island and the Magdalen Islands. Tropical storm wind warnings are in effect for western and northern Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, the Magdalen Islands, northern and southwestern Newfoundland, and parts of the Lower North Shore Quebec.\n\nb. Rainfall.\n\nRain bands ahead of the centre of Dorian have reached Nova Scotia and southern New Brunswick and will continue to spread northeastward this morning. Rainfall will be a major factor as torrential rain will lead to flooding in some areas. Widespread rainfall amounts of 50 to 100 mm are expected over Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and the Magdalen Islands. Maximum amounts are likely over western Nova Scotia where 100 to 200 mm are expected. Some districts have received large quantities of rain last week, and with the soil moisture still very high, excessive runoff may exacerbate the flooding potential. This combined with the severe winds will result in damage due to falling trees.\n\nRainfall warnings are in effect for Nova Scotia, western Prince Edward Island, most of New Brunswick stretching from the southwest towards the Gaspesie, and parts of the Lower North Shore Quebec. \n\nc. Surge/Waves.\n\nThere will also be rough and pounding surf, especially for parts of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Waves of 7 to 10 metres will reach the Southwestern Shore of Nova Scotia during the day and spread to the Eastern Shore tonight. These waves will likely reach southern Newfoundland by Sunday morning with waves nearing 12 metres. Waves of 4 to 7 metres will impact north facing coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Note that waves will break higher along some of the coastlines, and dangerous rip currents are likely. Please exercise extreme caution. \n\nStorm surge is an issue, for the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, the north coast of Prince Edward Island, southwestern Newfoundland, the Magdalen Islands, and Quebec's Lower North Shore. Current guidance suggests water levels approaching inundation levels during high tide. However, when combined with rough and pounding surf, there may be flooding and overwash of waves. \n\nStorm surge warnings are in effect for the north shore of Prince Edward Island, western Cape Breton, the Magdalen Islands, Quebec's Lower Quebec North Shore, and Anticosti Island.\n\n3. Marine weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nAs Dorian continues to move into our waters, it will spread hurricane force southeasterlies near and south of its track, over offshore Canadian waters. As the hurricane moves further into the Maritimes, storm to hurricane force northwesterlies will develop behind it. Waves of 10 to 15 metres are expected south of the storm track, beginning late today over southwestern waters and approaching the south coast of Newfoundland Sunday morning. As the low continues east Sunday into Monday, waves of 4 to 7 metres will develop over eastern waters, and for the southwestern Grand Banks will build to 5 to 10 metres.\n\nHurricane force wind warnings are in effect for most Atlantic waters, storm warnings are in effect for other waters in the Maritimes. For Newfoundland, hurricane force wind warnings are in effect for eastern Gulf of St. Lawrence waters, storm force warnings for the southwest and northeast coasts, and the strait of Belle Isle. Gale warnings are in effect for the remaining waters.\n\nForecasters: Couturier/McArthur/March\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-09-08T17:27:03-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-09-07T11:28:03-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2335790007.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Fredericton and Southern York County, Oromocto and Sunbury County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Stanley - Doaktown - Blackville Area, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Kouchibouguac National Park, Fundy National Park, Miramichi and area, Acadian Peninsula, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I., Avalon Peninsula North, Avalon Peninsula Southeast, St. John's and vicinity, Avalon Peninsula Southwest, Burin Peninsula, Connaigre, Burgeo - Ramea, Channel-Port aux Basques and vicinity, Corner Brook and vicinity, Deer Lake - Humber Valley, Gros Morne, Bay St. George, Buchans and the interior, Grand Falls-Windsor and vicinity, Bay of Exploits, Bonavista North, Bonavista Peninsula, Clarenville and vicinity, Gander and vicinity, Green Bay - White Bay, Terra Nova, Northern Peninsula East, Parson's Pond - Hawke's Bay, Port Saunders and the Straits, Red Bay to L'Anse-au-Clair, Norman Bay to Lodge Bay, Cartwright to Black Tickle, Eagle River, Chevery, Blanc-Sablon, Anticosti, Îles-de-la-Madeleine",
