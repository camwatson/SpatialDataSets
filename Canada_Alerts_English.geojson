Snow is expected to begin Monday morning and quickly become heavy. Northerly winds gusting near 60 or 70 km/h are also likely resulting in widespread blowing snow. Snow and blowing snow will continue into Monday night before tapering to flurries on Tuesday. \n\nTotal snowfall amounts of 40 cm or more are possible. \n\nThere is some uncertainty in snowfall amounts as a slight shift in the track and strength of this low pressure system may drastically change associated snowfall amounts.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
