				"Summary" : "Description: The next Pacific storm arrives tonight with a mix of wintery weather.\n\nAn approaching Pacific storm will bring a mixture of snow, freezing rain, and rain to the south coast beginning tonight and continuing Saturday. Strong winds will also accompany the storm. \n\nThe storm will arrive tonight with snow beginning late this evening across the south coast. As warmer air associated with storm penetrates the region, the snow will begin to transition to rain. Timing this transition to rain is always challenging in these situations. There is a chance that this transition could be delayed resulting in higher snowfall amounts. It is also possible this transition will include a period of freezing rain.\n\nBy midday Saturday most areas of Metro Vancouver and the Sunshine Coast will have changed over to all rain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Winter Storm conditions possible overnight tonight and Saturday.\n\nAn approaching Pacific storm will bring a mixture of snow, freezing rain, and rain to the south coast beginning tonight and continuing Saturday. Strong winds will also accompany the storm. \n\nThe storm will arrive tonight with heavy snow beginning late this evening across the south coast. As warmer air associated with storm penetrates the region, the snow will begin to transition to rain. Timing this transition to rain is always challenging in these situations. There is a chance that this transition could be delayed resulting in higher snowfall amounts. It is also possible this transition will include a period of freezing rain.\n\nIn addition to heavy snow, freezing rain is also a significant threat from this storm. Over Fraser Valley, Howe Sound, and Whistler, temperatures near surface will likely remain slightly below zero due to cold outflow winds pouring out from the BC interior. This sets up ideal conditions for freezing rain as the warmer air overrides cold air trapped at the surface. \n\nAs a result as we move through late tonight and into Saturday, expect the snow to change or become mixed with freezing rain over these locations. It is uncertain how long this freezing rain could last as we transition to warmer temperatures rising above zero. \n\nStay tuned to the latest Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest warnings and forecasts.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Poor weather conditions may contribute to transportation delays.\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nWinter storm watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Winter Storm conditions possible overnight tonight and Saturday.\n\nAn approaching Pacific storm will bring a mixture of snow, freezing rain, and rain to the south coast beginning tonight and continuing Saturday. Strong winds will also accompany the storm. \n\nThe storm will arrive tonight with heavy snow beginning late this evening across the south coast. As warmer air associated with storm penetrates the region, the snow will begin to transition to rain. Timing this transition to rain is always challenging in these situations. There is a chance that this transition could be delayed resulting in higher snowfall amounts. It is also possible this transition will include a period of freezing rain.\n\nIn addition to heavy snow, freezing rain is also a significant threat from this storm. Over Fraser Valley, Howe Sound, and Whistler, temperatures near surface will likely remain slightly below zero due to cold outflow winds pouring out from the BC interior. This sets up ideal conditions for freezing rain as the warmer air overrides cold air trapped at the surface. \n\nAs a result as we move through late tonight and into Saturday, expect the snow to change or become mixed with freezing rain over these locations. It is uncertain how long this freezing rain could last as we transition to warmer temperatures rising above zero. \n\nStay tuned to the latest Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest warnings and forecasts.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Poor weather conditions may contribute to transportation delays.\n\nWinter storm watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-01-18T05:07:36-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-01-17T13:08:36-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2385887546.2020<br>Area: Whistler, Howe Sound, Fraser Valley - west including Abbotsford, Fraser Valley - central including Chilliwack, Fraser Valley - east including Hope",

				"Summary" : "Description: A strong weather disturbance will bring highly variable weather conditions to southern Manitoba later this afternoon through Saturday.\n\nA large change in the weather is on the way for southern Manitoba. Snow will begin spreading into the province from the south today, intensifying this evening and through the night. The highest snowfall accumulations  will occur over the Red River Valley, southern Interlake, and areas eastwards. General accumulations of 10 to 20 cm are forecast in these areas  before the snow tapers off on Saturday with lesser amounts to the west and north.\n\nThrough the night, moderate northwesterly winds will develop, combining with the falling snow to produce areas of reduced visibility in blowing snow. The areas most impacted by blowing snow tonight will likely be the Red River Valley.\n\nOn Saturday, light snow will continue through the day across much of southern Manitoba with a further accumulation of 1 to 3 cm. The northwesterly winds will strengthen to 40 gusting 70 km/h with temperatures hovering in the low minus teens to -20°C range. The accumulated snow, continuing light snow, and strong winds will produce widespread blowing snow through the day. Winds will gradually ease on Saturday night with improving conditions.\n\nWarnings are in place for several regions in southern Manitoba, but may need to be adjusted as the system approaches. Please stay alert for updated bulletins. Anyone who has plans to travel on area highways tonight or Saturday should ensure that they check local weather forecasts (https://weather.gc.ca/forecast/canada/index_e.html?id=mb) regional highway conditions (https://manitoba511.ca/en/) before travelling. Ensure that your vehicle contains a winter emergency kit (https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/sfttps/tp201012-en.aspx) in case poor travelling conditions cause you to be stranded for a period of time. Poor travelling conditions will also develop through the Dakotas and Minnesota, where this system will bring higher snowfall accumulations along with strong winds.\n\nTemperatures will remain below-seasonal through the remainder of the weekend, but a milder weather pattern is likely to develop next week.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Inland  communities will receive the heaviest amounts as snow continues through Saturday morning.\n\nTotal snowfall accumulation of 10 to 15 cm is expected.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
