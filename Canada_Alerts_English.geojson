				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions will be favourable for the development of waterspouts this evening. The risk will remain through the overnight hours and into Saturday morning.\n\n###\n\nWind speeds inside the spray ring of a waterspout are 45 knots or higher. Vulnerable vessels are at risk of damage or capsizing. Keep in mind that waterspouts cannot be seen at night and may strike suddenly.\n\nWaterspouts are generally isolated in nature although they can also occur in families of two or more. Waterspouts sometimes appear as funnel clouds with swirling water visible near the surface.\n\nWaterspouts are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. Under favourable conditions, this weak rotation could intensify and become a tornado.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. For more information monitor Canadian Coast Guard radio or Weatheradio stations.<br>Expires: 2020-10-17T18:52:42-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-10-17T02:53:42-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0835209668.2020<br>Area: Eastern Lake Erie, Western Lake Erie",

This cold front is expected to produce brief periods of intense snowfall and reduced visibilities. \n\nThe risk for snow squalls will diminish later this evening as the front pushes into Montana.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
