				"Summary" : "Description: Tropical storm force winds of 70 gusting to 100 km/h and possibly higher over exposed areas from Post-tropical Storm Dorian can be expected over the above regions.\n\nTropical storm conditions are expected to diminish as Dorian quickly moves through the region.\n\nDorian is now moving off the Great Northern Peninsula. Strong southwesterly winds gusting up to 110 km/h are expected, especially along coastal areas east and south of the low centre.\n\nA special weather statement is in effect for the possibility of flooding from storm surge and waves.\n\n###\n\nThis could result in some damage to docks and breakwaters. Shoreline erosion and wave overwash is expected where winds blow onshore. These winds could break large tree branches resulting in downed utility lines. Some damage to signage and roof shingles may also occur.\n\nA tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds near 65 km/h or more) are expected over parts of the region within 24 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. Reports of storm conditions and impacts can be emailed directly to NSstorm@canada.ca or by tweeting reports by province using #NSStorm, #NBStorm, #PEStorm, #NLwx, #QCStorm or #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-09-09T06:59:39-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-09-08T23:58:39-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.4078066867.2019<br>Area: Bay of Exploits, Green Bay - White Bay, Northern Peninsula East, Port Saunders and the Straits",
