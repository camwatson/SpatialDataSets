Winds gusting up to 150 km/h are expected, especially along coastal areas.\n\n###\n\nThese winds will topple many trees leading to downed utility lines and extended service outages.

				"Summary" : "Description: Very high Storm Surge levels are expected to impact parts of the coast.\n\nHigh winds and large waves from Post-tropical storm Dorian have lead to higher than normal water levels this evening near high tide. Water levels at Shediac have risen dramatically to 3.2 metres and 2.6 metres at Escuminac. Water levels will remain high into the overnight hours and should decrease early tomorrow morning.\n\n###\n\nCoastal flooding is likely near the shoreline and nearby low-lying areas. Surge and waves can cause impacts well inland.\n\nStorm surge warnings are issued when water levels pose a threat to coastal regions.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to NBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #NBStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-09-08T11:59:34-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-09-08T02:00:34-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0377388912.2019<br>Area: Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Kouchibouguac National Park, Miramichi and area",

Dorian will slowly weaken as it moves northeastward into the Strait of Belle Isle later today and east of Labrador tonight.\n\n1. Summary of basic information at 03:00 a.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: Near 47.4 North 61.7 West.\n\nAbout: Near Magdalen Islands.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 130 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: northeast at 41 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 962 millibars.\n\n\n2. Public weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nDorian is currently moving through the Gulf of St Lawrence and is slowly weakening. However it is still producing high winds and heavy rain.\n\nPowerful winds and heavy rain will continue to impact parts of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, the Magdalen Islands and the Quebec's Lower North Shore early this morning. Winds over parts of Nova Scotia and southwestern New Brunswick will continue to diminish this morning, and any remaining warnings there will be ended shortly. Large waves and ocean swells will continue along the Atlantic coasts of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and for eastern portions of the Gulf of St. Lawrence tonight. Elevated water levels and storm surge over parts of eastern New Brunswick will subside this morning. Elevated water levels are expected along Anticosti Island and parts of Quebec's Lower North Shore. \n\nHurricane warnings will be ended early this morning for most of mainland Nova Scotia but will be maintained for Cape breton and western Newfoundland.  \n\nTropical storm warnings will be continued for Prince Edward Island, parts of northern and southwestern Newfoundland, the Magdalen Islands and parts of Quebec's Lower North Shore. \n\n\na. Wind.\n\nMany of the regions in and bordering the Gulf of St Lawrence will continue to be impacted by potentially damaging winds this morning. Wind impacts will likely be enhanced by foliage on the trees, causing broken branches, some tree falls, and power outages. \n\nb. Rainfall.\n\nRainfall warnings are continued for parts of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, the Gaspesie, and parts of the Lower North Shore Quebec. Rainfall amounts of 50 to 100 mm are possible in these regions. \n\nc. Surge/Waves.\n\nStorm surge warnings remain in effect for the many coastal regions along the Gulf of St Lawrence, as well as portions of southwestern Newfoundland.\n\nThere will also be rough and pounding surf and large ocean swells, along the Atlantic coast of eastern Nova Scotia and southern coastlines of Newfoundland this morning, where waves of 6 to 10 metres will come ashore. Waves of 4 to 7 metres will impact north facing coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Note that waves will break higher along some of the coastlines, and dangerous rip currents are likely. Please exercise extreme caution. \n\n\n3. Marine weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nHurricane force wind warnings remain in effect for most waters in and around the Gulf of St Lawrence. Storm and gale warnings are in effect for adjacent Maritimes waters, and for Newfoundland marine waters in the path or Dorian.\n\nSignificant wave heights of 6 to 10 metres are occurring in offshore waters south of Nova Scotia, and these will move into the southwest coast of Newfoundland this morning. Waves of 4 to 7 metres will develop over Gulf of St Lawrence waters this morning. \n\nForecasters: Borgel/Hatt\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-09-08T23:59:02-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-09-08T05:37:02-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3190278942.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Fredericton and Southern York County, Oromocto and Sunbury County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Stanley - Doaktown - Blackville Area, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Kouchibouguac National Park, Fundy National Park, Miramichi and area, Acadian Peninsula, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I., Avalon Peninsula North, Avalon Peninsula Southeast, St. John's and vicinity, Avalon Peninsula Southwest, Burin Peninsula, Connaigre, Burgeo - Ramea, Channel-Port aux Basques and vicinity, Corner Brook and vicinity, Deer Lake - Humber Valley, Gros Morne, Bay St. George, Buchans and the interior, Grand Falls-Windsor and vicinity, Bay of Exploits, Bonavista North, Bonavista Peninsula, Clarenville and vicinity, Gander and vicinity, Green Bay - White Bay, Terra Nova, Northern Peninsula East, Parson's Pond - Hawke's Bay, Port Saunders and the Straits, Red Bay to L'Anse-au-Clair, Norman Bay to Lodge Bay, Cartwright to Black Tickle, Eagle River, Chevery, Blanc-Sablon, Anticosti, Îles-de-la-Madeleine",
