Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted. Exposure is particularly a concern for infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nChildren, including teenagers, are at higher risk from outdoor air pollution because they often spend time being active outdoors.

				"Summary" : "Description: ROAD DUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR BURNS LAKE\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Northern Health has issued a Road Dust Advisory for Burns Lake because of high concentrations of coarse particulate matter that are expected to persist until there is precipitation or dust suppression.  Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice. \n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted.  Exposure is particularly a concern for infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at:\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-04-04T20:28:36-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

In the Makkovik area, snow will taper to scattered flurries this afternoon before redeveloping tonight. Snow for all regions will taper to flurries through the day on Friday. Further amounts of 15 to 25 cm are expected by Friday afternoon.\n\nStrong northeasterly winds gusting to 80 km/h will spread northwards up the coast today. These gusty winds, combined with the heavy snow, will result in reduced visibilities in blowing snow. Conditions will improve tonight as winds ease somewhat. However, strong northwesterly winds with gusts to 80 km/h will redevelop early in the day on Friday, reducing visibilities in blowing snow once again.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
