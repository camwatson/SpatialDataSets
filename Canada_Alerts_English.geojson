				"Summary" : "Description: For Tropical Depression Erin.\n\nThe next information statement will be issued by 09:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nTropical Depression Erin will begin tracking northeastward toward the Maritimes later today. Erin is expected to transition to a post-tropical storm well before it reaches southwestern Nova Scotia early Friday morning. Erin will bring heavy rain to much of the region beginning Thursday and strong, gusty winds with its passage Thursday night into Friday.\n\n1. Summary of basic information at 03:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: Near 33.7 North 73.1 West.\n\nAbout distance 284 kilometres southeast of Cape Hatteras NC.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 56 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: North at 20 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 1005 millibars.\n\n2. Public weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nTropical Depression Erin is expected to transition to a post-tropical system by the time it enters Canadian waters on Thursday. Rain associated with a trough of low pressure approaching from the west will spread over the western Maritimes early Thursday morning. As Erin approaches later on Thursday, some of its moisture will feed into this trough and likely enhance the rain intensity associated with it. The heavier rain and strongest winds associated directly with post-tropical Erin should reach the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia later Thursday evening. \n\na. Wind.\n\nSome gusty winds will likely accompany post-tropical Erin, especially to those areas just to the right of its track early Friday morning. At this time it is not expected that these winds will reach warning criteria (i.e. gusts to 90 km/h or higher), but could still be strong enough to cause isolated power outages and minor damage, especially given that trees are still in full leaf.\n\nb. Rainfall.\n\nThe combination of Post-Tropical Erin and its interaction with the trough of low pressure crossing the region on Thursday will combine to produce significant rainfall.  Rainfall will likely meet or exceed warning criteria (50 mm or more in 24 hours) in parts of the Maritimes, especially those areas just north and west of Erin's track. Some isolated locations in these areas could possibly see total rainfall amounts in excess of 100 mm before the rain ends later Friday morning\n\nc. Surge/Waves.\n\nAt this time, warning level storm surge and coastal impacts from high waves are not expected. However, some higher than normal water levels and high surf are possible near and to the right of the Erin's track where it is expected to cross the Atlantic Coast of Nova Scotia on Friday. After midnight into Friday morning waves near 4 metres will spread from west to east along the Atlantic Coast of Nova Scotia, and will break higher along the beaches. Rip currents will also be an issue, and the public should exercise caution near the coast.\n \n3. Marine weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nGale warnings have been issued for the southwestern Maritimes marine waters, where gale force southerlies up to 40 knots are expected by Thursday evening.  These gale warnings will likely be extended to adjacent marine areas for Friday near and along Erin's path through Canadian waters.\n\nForecaster(s): Mercer/Borgel\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-08-29T23:39:39-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-08-28T17:40:39-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2074932776.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Kouchibouguac National Park, Fundy National Park, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I.",
