The combination of snow and strong winds will create blizzard conditions with visibilities reduced to near zero in blowing snow.\n\nConditions are expected to improve early on Saturday for most areas but strong winds, snow and blowing snow will persist over coastal areas exposed to the north into Saturday afternoon.\n\nDamage to buildings, such as to roof shingles and windows, may occur. Store or anchor objects so they are not tossed by wind causing injury or damage.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be extremely hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least 4 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
