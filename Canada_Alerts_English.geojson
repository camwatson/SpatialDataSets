Air quality could deteriorate should the smoke go down to ground level.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nIf your home is not air-conditioned, be sure the house doesn't get too warm when doors and windows are closed to keep out smoke. Exposure to too much heat can also result in illness.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-06-23T00:56:36-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-22T08:57:36-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0389882935.2020<br>Area: Manic-5 area, Manic-3 area, Chutes-des-Passes - Pipmuacan Reservoir area, Labrieville area",
