				"Summary" : "Description: Freezing rain is expected or occurring.\n\nFreezing rain fell early this morning in the Saskatoon area, causing icy road conditions, then at 7 a.m. it changed over to snow. Radar shows this area of freezing rain tracking east-northeast towards Melfort, Wakaw, and Humboldt. It will likely produce icy roads before transitioning to snow by early this afternoon. Wynyard plus areas east and south of there should receive mostly rain from this system.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
