				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, damaging hail and heavy rain.\n\nA trough of low pressure tracking through southern Saskatchewan today will set off thunderstorms as it encounters the hot and humid airmass already in place. A few of these thunderstorms are likely to become severe this afternoon over portions of southwestern Saskatchewan, with the threat of severe thunderstorms shifting east and northeast this evening towards the Manitoba border.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The smoke plumes are likely to affect the regions through the weekend with winds remaining northwesterly or westerly.\n\nIf you or those in your care are exposed to wildfire smoke, consider taking extra precautions to reduce your exposure. Wildfire smoke is a constantly-changing mixture of particles and gasses which includes many chemicals that can harm your health. For more details, please consult www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-14T01:11:28-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-13T09:12:28-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0782217911.2019<br>Area: Sachigo Lake - Bearskin Lake, Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake, Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell",

				"Summary" : "Description: Elevated pollution levels are expected or occurring.\n\nAIR QUALITY ADVISORY FOR YUKON\n\nThe office of the Yukon Chief Medical Officer of Health has issued an Air Quality Advisory for all Yukon communities due to high or increasing concentrations of wildfire smoke.\n\nWildfires in Alaska and central Yukon are causing increased concentrations of smoke throughout the territory. Local conditions may also affect the concentration of smoke in each community.  Please note that there is no immediate wildfire threat to any Yukon communities.\n\nSmoke can impact your health if it lingers in your community. Please observe the following recommendations: \n\n- You may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, eye or throat irritation, or shortness of breath. If you are experiencing symptoms, limit outdoor activity and/or strenuous physical activity; if breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce the activity.\n\n-\tMake sure you identify and support those who are at increased risk from wildfire smoke. These include small children, elders, pregnant women, and those with lung or heart disease.\n\n-\tIf you have a health condition that could worsen with the smoke (asthma, chronic lung disease or COPD, or heart disease) check in with your health care provider to make sure that you have a plan for managing your condition. Make sure your medications and supplies are available and up-to-date. \n\n-\tReduce exposure to smoky air by staying indoors and turning on an air cleaner with a HEPA filter, if you have one. Keep indoor air as clean as possible by avoiding smoking or burning other materials.\n\n-\tIf your symptoms worsen or you are concerned about your health or the health of a friend/family member, contact the health line at 811, contact your health care provider, or go to your Community Health Centre or hospital emergency department.\n\n-\tFor advice about keeping your home air clean and cool visit www.hss.gov.yk.ca/wildfiresmoke.php\n\n-\tTo view an hourly forecast of smoke conditions in Yukon, visit www.firesmoke.ca/forecasts/current\n\n###\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-14T10:10:41-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Government of Yukon, 2019-07-13T18:11:41-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2861192473.2019<br>Area: Dawson, Mayo, Beaver Creek, Pelly - Carmacks, Kluane Lake, Haines Junction, Whitehorse, Teslin Y.T., Cassiar Mountains Y.T., Watson Lake Y.T., Faro - Ross River, Dempster, Old Crow",

A few of these thunderstorms are likely to become severe this afternoon over portions of southwestern Saskatchewan, with the threat of severe thunderstorms shifting east and northeast this evening towards the Manitoba border.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
