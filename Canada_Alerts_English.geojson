As rain will develop Thursday over Southwestern Quebec, areas further north and east will see snow at times heavy, which is expected to persist into Friday.   Snowfall amounts approaching 10 to 15 centimetres generally are expected over the affected areas, but areas over higher terrain such as the Appalachians, Charlevoix and the eastern tip of the Gaspé Peninsula could see snowfall amounts of 25 centimetres or upwards.\n\nThese snowfall amounts could make travel difficult.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
