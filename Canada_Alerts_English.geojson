				"Summary" : "Description: High levels of air pollution due to smoke from forest fires will continue this morning. \n\nSmoke plumes are moving over the region from several forest fires located in the Sandy Lake - Pikangikum region. Winds will become light southwesterly this morning which will direct smoke plumes to the northeast and east. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\nThese smoke plumes will continue to affect the region this morning. For communities north and east of the Sandy Lake - Pikangikum region the plumes will continue through today.\n\nIf you, or someone in your care, develop symptoms, reduce or reschedule strenuous outdoors activities where ever possible until the air quality improves.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-08T23:42:20-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-08T07:43:20-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3753245919.2019<br>Area: Attawapiskat, Sachigo Lake - Bearskin Lake, Big Trout Lake - Kasabonika, Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake, Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell, Summer Beaver - Wunnummin Lake - Kingfisher Lake, Pickle Lake - Cat Lake, Webequie, Fort Hope - Lansdowne House - Ogoki, Red Lake - Woodland Caribou Park, Ear Falls - Perrault Falls - Western Lac Seul, Savant Lake - Sturgeon Lake, Sioux Lookout - Eastern Lac Seul, Kenora - Grassy Narrows - Whitedog, Sioux Narrows - Nestor Falls - Morson, Dryden - Vermilion Bay, Ignace - English River, Fort Frances - Emo - Rainy River, Seine River Village - Mine Centre, Armstrong - Auden - Wabakimi Park, Gull Bay - Black Sturgeon Lake",
