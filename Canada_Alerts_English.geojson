				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility.\n\nSmoke from wildfires in northern Alberta continues to affect some areas in the southern Northwest Territories. Air quality remains poor over Fort Simpson, Hay River, and the Fort Providence areas. Winds are expected to continue to shift to a more northerly direction this afternoon and move the smoke away from the area.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk. If you, or someone in your care, develop symptoms, reduce strenuous outdoors activities where ever possible until the air quality improves.\n\nWhen outdoors, if your breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce strenuous physical activities. If you experience irritation of eyes, nose or throat, shortness of breath or other respiratory symptoms, you should take action to reduce your exposure to smoke. \n\nIf you are feeling unwell and experiencing symptoms, contact your health care provider for advice.\n\nIssued jointly by Environment Canada and the Northwest Territories Departments of Environment and Natural Resources and Health and Social Services.\n\nFor more information on air quality and your health, please visit the Northwest Territories Department of Health and Social Services at www.hss.gov.nt.ca/en/services/environmental-health/air-quality.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-22T02:59:09-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Northwest Territories Departments of Environment and Natural Resources and Health and Social Services, 2019-05-21T16:26:09-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2490453592.2019<br>Area: Ft.

Smoke is expected or occurring.\n\nThe regions of Watson Lake, Yk and Fort Nelson, BC are being impacted or are likely to be impacted by wildfire smoke from northern Alberta over the next 24-48 hours. \n\nThe next bulletin update will be available May 22,2019 and can be accessed online at: \n\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air/air-quality/air-advisories.\n\nBe informed: \nDuring a wildfire, smoke conditionscan change quickly over short distances and can vary  considerably hour-by-hour. Wildfire smoke is a natural part of our environment but it is important to be mindful that  exposure to smoke may affect your health. People with pre-existing health conditions, the  elderly, infants, children and sensitive individuals are more likely to experience health effects from smoke exposure.\n\nDuring smoky conditions:\nUse your common sense. \nStop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes difficult or you feel unwell. Stay cool and drink plenty of fluids. Carry any rescue medications with you at all times. Make sure  that children and others who cannot care for themselves follow the same advice. \nMonitor your symptoms.\nDifferent people have different responses to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears.\nPeople with asthma or other chronic illness should activate the personal care plans they have designed with their family physicians. If you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC at 8-1-1. If you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your health care provider, walk-in clinic, or emergency department. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\nTips to reduce your exposure.\nSmoke levels may be lower indoors but will still be elevated, so stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors. Running a commercially available HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter can improve indoor air quality in the room where the device is located. If you have a forced air heating/cooling system in your home, it may help to change the filter and set the fan to run continuously. Reduce indoor air pollution sources such as smoking, burning incense, and frying foods. Consider going to a library, community center, or shopping mall with cooler filtered air to get some relief from the smoke. If travelling in a car with air conditioning, keep the windows up and the ventilation set to recirculate. If you are very sensitive to smoke, consider moving to another location with cleaner air, but be aware that conditions can change rapidly. Maintaining good overall health is a good way to prevent health effects resulting from short-term exposure to air pollution. \n\nMore information:\n\nFor general information about wildfire smoke and your health, contact HealthLinkBC: Phone 8-1-1 (toll free, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week), or Check the Wildfires and Your Health webpage at https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-feature/wildfires.\n\nThe current Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and other air quality information is available at the BC Air Quality website, http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/bcairquality/readings/aqhi-table.xml.\n\nForecasts of smoke levels over the next 48 hours are available from the Environment and Climate Change Canada FireWork prediction system, https://weather.gc.ca/firework/indexe.html.\n\nIf you need to work outdoors in smoky conditions, material can be found at theWorkSafe BC Wildfire FAQ  website:\nhttps://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/information-sheets/wildfire-smoke-frequently-asked-questions-faq.\n\nFirst Nations Health Authority: http://www.fnha.ca/what-we-do/environmental-health/wildfire-information\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-22T14:02:06-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

Tonight winds will become northeasterly confining smoke near and south of High Level. Winds are expected to shift to a more northerly direction by morning which will likely cause the Special Air Quality Statement to be expanded into the Peace River region.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-22T13:43:01-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-05-21T21:44:01-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3160756122.2019<br>Area: Mackenzie Co. near Bistcho Lake, Mackenzie Co. near Rainbow Lake Zama Lake and Chateh, Mackenzie Co. near Zama City, Mackenzie Co. near Indian Cabins and Steen River, Mackenzie Co. near Meander River and Lutose, Mackenzie Co. near High Level and Bushe River Res., Co. of Northern Lights near Paddle Prairie Smt, Mackenzie Co. near the Caribou Mountains, Mackenzie Co. near Fort Vermilion, Mackenzie Co. near John D'or Prairie and Fox Lake, Mackenzie Co. near La Crête and Buffalo Head Prairie, Mackenzie Co. near the Tallcree and Wadlin Lake Reserves",
