				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nThe storm system affecting southern Manitoba continues to bring snow,\ngusty northwest winds and blowing snow to region. Snowfall totals\nacross the regions are highly variable. However, radar and surface\nreports indicate the highest amounts thus far have fallen west of the\nCity of Winnipeg along a line north to south in the vicinity of \nPortage la Prairie stretching northward into the Interlake and \nsouthward towards the US border. \n\nThe following amounts are snowfall totals from Friday morning to \nearly this morning. These reports are from the CoCoRaHS network and \nare in centimetres.\n\nWinnipeg 5.1 to 10.9\nPortage la Prairie 12.2 \nSteinbach 7.6\nWoodlands 15.2 \nSt. Francois Xavier 19.6 \nPinawa 15.5\nMorris 8.9\nHigh Bluff 8.1\nZhoda 6.4\nSt. Pierre Jolys 7.1\n\nSnow and blowing snow will continue today with storm total snowfall accumulations of 10 to 25 cm by the time the it tapers off this evening. \n\nNorthwest winds will continue to strengthen today with gusts up to 70 km/h. These winds combined with the falling snow will cause significantly reduced visibilities in blowing snow. \n\nConditions will gradually improve Saturday evening.\n\nAnyone who needs to travel on area highways today should ensure that they check local weather forecasts (https://weather.gc.ca/forecast/canada/index_e.html?id=mb) and regional highway conditions (https://manitoba511.ca/en/) before travelling. Ensure that your vehicle contains a winter emergency kit (https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/sfttps/tp201012-en.aspx) in case poor travelling conditions cause you to be stranded for a period of time. Travel conditions have also deteriorated through the Dakotas and Minnesota, where this disturbance has also brought snow and strong winds.\n\n###\n\nVisibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Snow squalls are expected to continue for much of the day Sunday before moving south of the area while weakening. Northwest winds gusting 60 or 70 km/h will also result in widespread blowing snow along with these snow squalls.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts up to 20 cm are possible from these snow squalls by Sunday evening. The highest amounts are expected along the Lake Huron shoreline from Kincardine and south towards Grand Bend.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.

Higher amounts are expected over the Red River valley and southeastern Manitoba where warnings are currently in place.\n\nNorthwesterly winds up to gusting at times to 60 km/h are combining with the falling snow to produce areas of reduced visibility in blowing snow. These conditions will persist through the afternoon with improvement occurring tonight. \n\nWarnings are in place for numerous regions in southern Manitoba. Please stay alert for updated bulletins. Anyone who has plans to travel on area highways today should ensure that they check local weather forecasts (https://weather.gc.ca/forecast/canada/index_e.html?id=mb) regional highway conditions (https://manitoba511.ca/en/) before travelling. Ensure that your vehicle contains a winter emergency kit (https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/sfttps/tp201012-en.aspx) in case poor travelling conditions cause you to be stranded for a period of time. Poor travelling conditions have also developed through the Dakotas and Minnesota, where this system is bringing higher snowfall accumulations along with strong winds.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
