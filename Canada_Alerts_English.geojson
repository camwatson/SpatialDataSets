				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total amounts of 10 to 20 cm is expected.\n\nA Pacific weather system spread snow across central Saskatchewan today. The snow will persist throughout the night, then taper off from west to east on Sunday. Snowfall amounts will likely end up in the 10 to 20 cm range, with up to 25 cm through the Melfort, Nipawin, and Hudson Bay areas. \n\nFurther south, amounts through tonight and Sunday will be in the 1 to 5 cm range as a cold front swings through, along with a risk of freezing rain or freezing drizzle tonight. Again, the precipitation in southern regions will end from west to east on Sunday.\n\nModerate to strong northeast winds in the areas receiving heavy snow will also give reduced visibilities in blowing snow, especially this evening.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The blizzard should end Sunday morning.\n\nIqaluit will see very strong northwest winds gusting to 90 km/h develop on Sunday as the low pressure system moves to the east. Near zero visibility can be expected in snow and blowing snow.  The blizzard should end early Monday morning.\n\nBoth communities will see wind chill values fall to near -46 during the blizzard.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The snow will persist throughout the night, then taper off from west to east on Sunday. Snowfall amounts will likely end up in the 10 to 20 cm range, with up to 25 cm through the Melfort, Nipawin, and Hudson Bay areas. \n\nFurther south, amounts through tonight and Sunday will be in the 1 to 5 cm range as a cold front swings through, along with a risk of freezing rain or freezing drizzle tonight. Again, the precipitation in southern regions will end from west to east on Sunday.\n\nModerate to strong northeast winds in the areas receiving heavy snow will also give reduced visibilities in blowing snow, especially this evening.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: An intense low pressure system will bring significant amounts of rain beginning Monday evening through Tuesday evening over Southern and Central Quebec.\n\nFurther north, snowfall amounts of 15 to 25 centimetres are possible from Monday morning to Tuesday evening in a corridor stretching from Abitibi towards Chaleur Bay, including Quebec City. Snow accompanied by moderate winds may reduce visibilities locally in blowing snow.\n\nFreezing rain is likely in the vicinity of the snow-to-rain transition area. A more important episode of freezing rain is also likely for areas of the St. Lawrence Valley between Montreal and Quebec City. Travel could be difficult, especially at rush hour Tuesday morning.\n\nThere is still much uncertainty about the track of this system and thus about the type and amount of precipitation expected.\n\nPlease stay tuned for future forecasts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
