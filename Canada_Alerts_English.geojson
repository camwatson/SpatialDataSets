				"Summary" : "Description: Snow continues today. \n\nSnow will continue today, with an additional 5 centimetres expected.  This will result in total snowfall accumulations of 10 to 15 cm by this evening. \n\nLocal total snowfall amounts of 15 to 20 cm are possible near the Minnesota Border. However in general, the criterion for snowfall warning is not expected to be reached across Northwestern Ontario.\n\nStrong easterly winds with gusts to 60 km/h will also generate occasional blowing snow giving reduced visibilities.\n\nThe snow may become mixed with freezing drizzle at times, especially for areas close to Lake Superior.\n\nHazardous winter driving conditions due to low visibility in occasional heavy snow and blowing snow, and accumulating snow on untreated roads are expected. \n\nThe heaviest snowfall associated with this Colorado Low will remain south of the international border where Winter Storm Warnings are in effect.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
