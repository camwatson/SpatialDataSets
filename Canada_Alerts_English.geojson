				"Summary" : "Description: Elevated pollution levels are expected or occurring.\n\nDUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR SMITHERS AND BURNS LAKE\n\n(March  10,  2021  07:00  -  Smithers)  The  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Climate  Change Strategy in collaboration with the Northern Health Authority has issued a Dust Advisory for Smithers and Burns Lake because of high concentrations of coarse particulate matter that are expected to persist until there is precipitation, dust suppression or a change in traffic patterns.  Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations.  This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nExposure  is  particularly  a  concern  for  individuals  with  chronic  conditions  such  as asthma,  COPD, heart disease,  and diabetes,  respiratory infections such as COVID-19,  pregnant  women,  infants,  and  older  adults.  Persons  with  chronic  underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted.  Where appropriate, maintain physical distancing.  Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation,  chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce particulate matter exposure. \n\nReal-time  air  quality  observations  and  information  regarding  the  health  effects  of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-03-12T20:57:23-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations.  This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nExposure  is  particularly  a  concern  for  individuals  with  chronic  conditions  such  as asthma,  COPD, heart disease,  and diabetes,  respiratory infections such as COVID-19,  pregnant  women,  infants,  and  older  adults.  Persons  with  chronic  underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted.  Where appropriate, maintain physical distancing.  Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation,  chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider.
