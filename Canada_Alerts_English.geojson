				"Summary" : "Description: Heavy rain for the Central Interior tonight, Wednesday and Thursday. \n\nCurrent guidance suggests 20 to 40 mm of rain is possible through Thursday, with the higher rainfall amounts expected over the mountains. However, there remains some uncertainty about just how much rain will fall during this prolonged event. In addition to the widespread synoptic rain, thunderstorms will have the potential of adding 15-25 mm over short periods.\n\nA low pressure system developing over Southern Alberta today will intensify as it moves northward into Northern Alberta by Wednesday evening. The system will funnel rain across the central interior.\n\nShowers will transition into rain, heavy at times, tonight or Wednesday morning. The rain will taper off on Thursday morning, but showers are likely Thursday afternoon.  \n\nThere is also significant concern for moderate rain and flows in the Quesnel River (Cariboo Mountains), the North Thompson (Blue River/Clearwater region), and South Thompson (Shuswap). Although the rainfall amounts may not be exceptionally heavy, the severity of this event pertains to the resulting rising rivers.\n\nRainfall warnings may be issued as the system further develops and confidence in rainfall amounts increases.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-01T13:25:29-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-30T21:26:29-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2679438164.2020<br>Area: South Thompson, Shuswap, North Thompson, North Columbia, Cariboo - north including Quesnel, Cariboo - south including Williams Lake, 100 Mile, Yellowhead, Prince George, McGregor",

The system will funnel rain onto the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nBC North Peace River\nFor BC North Peace River, including Fort St. John, the rain will start Wednesday morning. The light rain will change to rain, heavy at times, by mid afternoon and continue until Thursday evening.\n\nFort Nelson Region\nSouthern portions of the Fort Nelson Region can expect periods of rain to continue from tonight through Friday with heavier rain falling Wednesday afternoon through Thursday morning. This rain will taper off early Thursday afternoon.\n\nMuncho Lake Region\nEastern sections of the Muncho Lake Region will receive heavy rain beginning Wednesday afternoon and persisting through Thursday afternoon. The rain will taper off to showers Thursday evening.\n\nRainfall warnings may be issued as the system further develops and confidence in rainfall amounts increases.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

However, there remains some uncertainty about just how much rain will fall during this prolonged event.\n\nA low pressure system will develop over Southern Alberta today and then intensify as it moves northward into Northern Alberta by Wednesday evening. The system will funnel rain onto the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nBC North Peace River\nFor BC North Peace River, including Fort St. John, the rain will start Wednesday morning. The light rain will change to rain, heavy at times, by mid afternoon and continue until Thursday evening.\n\nFort Nelson Region\nSouthern portions of the Fort Nelson Region can expect periods of rain to continue from tonight through Friday with heavier rain falling Wednesday afternoon through Thursday morning. This rain will taper off early Thursday afternoon.\n\nMuncho Lake Region\nEastern sections of the Muncho Lake Region will receive heavy rain beginning Wednesday afternoon and persisting through Thursday afternoon. The rain will taper off to showers Thursday evening.\n\nRainfall warnings may be issued as the system further develops and confidence in rainfall amounts increases.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Large hail, torrential downpours and damaging wind gusts will be associated with the strongest of these thunderstorms.\n\nThe threat of severe weather will begin to push eastward tonight as the low pressure system evolves.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing damaging wind gusts, damaging hail and torrential rain.\n\nSevere thunderstorms associated with a low pressure system currently in North Dakota are pushing northwards into Canada this evening. Large hail, torrential downpours and damaging wind gusts will be associated with the strongest of these thunderstorms.\n\nThe threat of severe weather will begin to push eastward tonight as the low pressure system evolves.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-01T07:59:38-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-01T01:09:38-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2293519649.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Wallace-Woodworth incl.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing damaging wind gusts, damaging hail and torrential rain.\n\nSevere thunderstorms associated with a low pressure system currently in North Dakota are pushing northwards into Canada this evening. Large hail, torrential downpours and damaging wind gusts will be associated with the strongest of these thunderstorms.\n\nThe threat of severe weather will begin to push eastward tonight as the low pressure system evolves.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Large hail, torrential downpours and damaging wind gusts will be associated with the strongest of these thunderstorms.\n\nThe threat of severe weather will begin to push eastward tonight as the low pressure system evolves.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
