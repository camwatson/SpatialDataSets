These storms are capable of producing 2 cm hail, gusty winds to 90 km/h, and locally heavy downpours. These storms will dissipate later this evening.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

These storms are capable of producing 2 cm hail, gusty winds to 90 km/h, and locally heavy downpours. These storms will dissipate later this evening.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
