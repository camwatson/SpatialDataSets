				"Summary" : "Description: Moist easterly flow associated with a deep Alberta low will continue to stream moisture across the Rocky Mountains and into B.C. today. \n\nMost of these regions have already received significant amounts of rain over the past 24 hours, ranging from 15 to 30 mm, with higher amounts over the mountains, locally up to 30-50 mm. \n\nAs the main band of organized rainfall slides further North, rain will end rapidly this morning across the Cariboo but persist along an axis extending from Williston to Prince George to Blue River. However, the unstable airmass over regions to the south will favour the development of showers and thunderstorms later in the day. Some heavier showers and thunderstorms will have the potential of adding 10-15 mm locally over short periods well into this evening.\n\nHigher rainfall amounts are expected over the mountains, especially over the Williston, McGregor, and Cariboo regions where storm totals will reach 40 to 60 mm.-\n\nAlthough the rainfall amounts may not be exceptionally heavy, the significance of this event is due to the potential for rising rivers levels. There is significant concern for high flows in the Quesnel River (Cariboo Mountains), the North Thompson (Blue River/Clearwater region), and South Thompson (Shuswap).\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
