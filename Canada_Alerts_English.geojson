				"Summary" : "Description: Winter Weather Travel Advisory in effect for this afternoon and this evening.\n\nA well organized snow squall originating from Lake Huron will move across the area late this afternoon into this evening.  At this point, it seems very likely this band will impact the afternoon/evening commute in the Golden Horseshoe from Oshawa to Hamilton.  This band may also impact the 401 corridor from Oshawa to Kingston late this afternoon as well.  \n\nThis band will be capable of producing quick accumulations of 2 to 5 cm in an hour along with sudden reductions to visibility in heavy snow.   \n\nThe timing of this snowfall may potentially lengthen afternoon commute times significantly. Travelers are advised to exercise caution and allow extra time to reach their destination.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
