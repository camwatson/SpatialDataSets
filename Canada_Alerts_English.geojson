Precipitation spreads onto Vancouver Island late this morning and onto the south coast early this afternoon. Strong southeasterly winds will also develop this afternoon.\n\nInitially temperatures will be cold enough to allow some of the precipitation to start as wet snow over higher elevations of Vancouver Island and the south coast. \n\nBy this evening warm air accompanying the storm will drive freezing levels and temperatures higher so that precipitation changes to rain for most communities. The exception may be Whistler and the Sea to Sky Highway from Squamish to Whistler where snow could persist longer.\n\nThe heavy rain and strong winds continue all day on Friday. The highest rainfall amounts will be over the central coast, north and west Vancouver Island. Areas of Squamish, northern sections of Metro Vancouver, and the Fraser Valley will also significant amounts of rainfall.\n\nIn areas where snow does accumulate, a higher chance of localized flooding is possible due to rain on snow.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A strong winter storm will impact the BC interior with snow beginning this evening.\n\nThe approaching storm will give widespread snow into the interior this evening. The main band of snow will shift northwards on Friday morning,  allowing the snow to come to an end for communities in the Okanagan, South Thompson, and Kootenays. However over the Columbias, the central and northern interior the snow will continue all day.\n\nThe highest snowfall amounts are expected to be over the Bulkley Valley, McGregor, Yellowhead and Williston regions.\n\nIn addition there is a chance of freezing rain for the central interior as the band of snow pushes northwards on Friday morning.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
