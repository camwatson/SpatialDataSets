				"Summary" : "Description: A slow moving low pressure system in Montana pushed a swath of precipitation into southern Saskatchewan today and will continue through the night and into Saturday.\n\nThe main precipitation swath is forecast to remain over Shaunavon into the night and throughout Saturday before weakening Saturday evening. Today, rainfall reports throughout the region have been between 10 and 30 mm. Tonight, another 20 to 30 mm of rain is forecast. On Saturday, before the system begins to weaken, areas in the region could see an additional 10 to 15 mm. \n\nLeader and Swift Current have been added to the rainfall warning as satellite, radar, and current model guidance are indicating the swath of precipitation will remain over these regions throughout the night and into Saturday. These regions are forecast to receive 20 to 30 mm of rain this evening, and an additional 10 to 20 mm of rain on Saturday before the system begins to weaken.\n\nThe main band of the precipitation swath has moved out of the Assiniboia region, but scattered showers will continue throughout the region this evening and into Saturday. Although the heaviest rain has moved out of the region, an additional 10 to 15 mm of rain is expected with the showers, so, the warning continues. The rainfall warning will likely be ended Saturday morning. \n\nIt is worthy to note that within this system, there are pockets of heavier precipitation, therefore rainfall amounts will be highly variable across the regions.\n\n###\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-06-22T13:53:16-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-06-21T21:54:16-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1635653747.2019<br>Area: Big Lakes County near Enilda and Joussard, Big Lakes County near Hilliard's Bay Prov.
