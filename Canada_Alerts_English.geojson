The ground, already near saturation, has little ability to absorb further rainfall.\n\nA low pressure system over northern Alberta will continue to give rain at times heavy to the Fort Nelson and Muncho Lake - Stone Mountain Park regions tonight through Monday. Total rainfall amounts of 50 to 90 mm can be expected by Monday evening. \n\nGiven the wet antecedent conditions in the region this past month (including a similar weather system last weekend), the ground is already saturated in many areas. The prolonged moderate to heavy rainfall may result in higher overland runoff. \n\nFlood warnings and advisories from the BC River Forecast Centre can be found at: http://bcrfc.env.gov.bc.ca/warnings/index.htm .\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Rain, at times heavy, continues. The ground, already near saturation, has little ability to absorb further rainfall.\n\nA low pressure system over northern Alberta will continue to give rain at times heavy to the Fort Nelson and Muncho Lake - Stone Mountain Park regions tonight through Monday. Total rainfall amounts of 50 to 90 mm can be expected by Monday evening. \n\nGiven the wet antecedent conditions in the region this past month (including a similar weather system last weekend), the ground is already saturated in many areas. The prolonged moderate to heavy rainfall may result in higher overland runoff. \n\nFlood warnings and advisories from the BC River Forecast Centre can be found at: http://bcrfc.env.gov.bc.ca/warnings/index.htm .\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather in British Columbia or Yukon, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or YTstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm or #YTStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-06-15T14:34:44-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-14T22:35:44-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1957579167.2020<br>Area: Muncho Lake Park - Stone Mountain Park",
