The spell of hot weather associated with the ridge will continue through Thursday.\n\nAt this time we don't expect to issue a widespread Heat Warning for the southern interior. However, the public is encouraged to protect themselves from the heat. \n- Drink plenty of water even before you feel thirsty and stay in a cool place.\n- Schedule outdoor activities during the coolest parts of the day.\n- Never leave people or pets inside a parked vehicle.\n\nCommunities will see daytime highs soar into mid-30s while overnight lows recover to the low to mid-teens.  \n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada's criteria for issuing a Heat Warning requires maximum temperatures greater than 35C and overnight lows greater than 18C for two or more consecutive days. Many locales will reach or exceed the 35C high temperature threshold but most areas will drop below 18C at night. \n\nA reprieve from the heat will begin on Friday. The transition to more seasonal temperatures will be accompanied by thunderstorms.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
