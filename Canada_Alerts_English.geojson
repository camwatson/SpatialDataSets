Local blowing snow reducing visibilities to near zero will also be a concern. \n\nLocal snow squalls are expected to taper off when the winds shift to southwest Wednesday afternoon.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Storm moving into region will bring significant rainfall starting this morning and extending into Wednesday morning.\n\nA developing system will affect Nova Scotia beginning early this morning. Over northern areas of the province, precipitation began with a short period of snow, which now has switched to rain in the southwest. Total snowfall accumulations are forecast to be less than 5 centimetres. \n\nThe rain will spread over the province by mid-day and will persist tonight. Rainfall warnings have been issued for the most of mainland Nova Scotia with the exception of the Annapolis Valley region and the Cobequid Peninsula. It is possible that these may be extended to other parts Nova Scotia as the system approaches, should the forecast track or intensity of the system change.\n\nRain will change to flurries over western Nova Scotia late tonight night as cold westerly winds move into the region and temperatures quickly fall below freezing.  Driving conditions may become icy overnight or Wednesday morning as the cold air and flurries push eastward across the province.\n\nThe travelling public are urged to prepare for potentially difficult driving conditions tonight and Tuesday morning in areas of northern mainland Nova Scotia and northwestern Cape Breton receiving snow.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
