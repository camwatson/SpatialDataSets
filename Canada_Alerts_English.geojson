Higher amounts are expected over the Red River valley and southeastern Manitoba where warnings are currently in place.\n\nNorthwesterly winds up to 50 gusting 70 km/h will spread eastwards across southern Manitoba on Saturday night, combining with the falling snow to produce areas of reduced visibility in blowing snow which will persist through Saturday with improvement occurring Saturday night. \n\nWarnings are in place for numerous regions in southern Manitoba. Please stay alert for updated bulletins. Anyone who has plans to travel on area highways tonight or Saturday should ensure that they check local weather forecasts (https://weather.gc.ca/forecast/canada/index_e.html?id=mb) regional highway conditions (https://manitoba511.ca/en/) before travelling. Ensure that your vehicle contains a winter emergency kit (https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/sfttps/tp201012-en.aspx) in case poor travelling conditions cause you to be stranded for a period of time. Poor travelling conditions have also developed through the Dakotas and Minnesota, where this system is bringing higher snowfall accumulations along with strong winds.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow and blowing snow over the weekend...\n\nA low pressure system will track across Southern Quebec and is expected to give 10 to 15 centimetres of snow between Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon.\n\nIn addition, moderate to occasionally strong easterlies will cause blowing snow locally, mainly in exposed areas such as the Saint Lawrence and the Outaouais Valleys.\n\nThe snowfall, reduced visibilities and cold temperatures should make for poor road conditions and difficult travel conditions.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA strong Pacific storm arrives tonight with a mix of wintery weather including snow, freezing rain, and blowing snow.\n\nThe storm will arrive tonight with snow beginning this evening across East and Central Vancouver Island. Total snowfall of 10 to 20 cm is expected by Saturday morning. However, local 5 to 10 cm are expected near sea level.\n\nStrong winds will also accompany the storm. As a result blowing snow is expected overnight tonight and early Saturday morning.\n\nAs warmer air associated with storm penetrates the region, the snow will likely transition to freezing rain over central Vancouver Island overnight tonight. \n\nA complete change over to rain is expected by Saturday morning for all regions. \n\nTiming this transition from snow to freezing rain is always challenging in these situations. There is a chance that this transition could be delayed resulting in higher snowfall amounts.\n\nStay tuned to the latest Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest warnings and forecasts.\n\n###\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Blizzard conditions with gusty winds and visibility frequently near zero in snow and blowing snow are expected or occurring.\n\nLocations: northeastern Newfoundland.\n\nAdditional snowfall: 2 cm.\n\nMaximum wind gusts: northwesterly 100 km/h, except up to 120 along parts of the coast.\n\nTime span: until later this morning inland, until this afternoon along the coast.\n\nRemarks: Snow will taper off this morning. The combination of fresh snowfall and strong winds will create blizzard conditions with visibilities reduced to near zero in blowing snow.\n\nConditions are expected to improve this morning for most areas but strong winds and blowing snow will persist over coastal areas exposed to the north into this afternoon.\n\nDamage to buildings, such as to roof shingles and windows, may occur.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be extremely hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least 4 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
