				"Summary" : "Description: Coastal flood warning issued jointly by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (Science) and the Meteorological Service of Canada - Quebec Region on 2020-12-17.\n\nHigher than normal water levels and waves are expected near the coast this evening.\n\nA strong area of high pressure will bring moderate northeasterly winds to the region mentioned below. The combination of these winds and the fact that we are currently in a period of high amplitude tidal range could cause minor flooding along the coast near these localities, on the dates and at the times specified (Eastern Standard Time).\n\nQuebec City: 2020-12-17, from 06:30 p.m. to 09:30 p.m.\n\n###\n\nCoastal flooding is possible along the shoreline. Coastal erosion is possible in vulnerable areas.\n\nStorm surge warnings are issued when water levels pose a threat to coastal regions.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to QCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #QCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-12-18T04:59:46-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-12-17T21:00:46-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3583388826.2020<br>Area: Québec area, Côte-de-Beaupré - L'Île d'Orléans area, Bellechasse area, Lévis area",
