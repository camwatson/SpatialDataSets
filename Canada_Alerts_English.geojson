				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility. Smoke is expected or occurring.\n\nSmoke plumes moving over the Dawson, Mayo, and Beaver Creek regions from forest fires in the Yukon will continue today. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-09-17T00:27:17-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Government of Yukon, 2019-09-16T09:08:17-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1640545163.2019<br>Area: Dawson, Mayo, Beaver Creek",
