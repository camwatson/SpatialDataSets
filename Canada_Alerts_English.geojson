				"Summary" : "Description: This is a Manitoba Emergency Alert. Manitoba Infrastructure‚Äôs Hydrologic Forecast Centre has issued a High Water Advisory for southwestern, western and central regions of Manitoba. A weather system may release 75 to 100 millimetres of rain in these areas in between June 28 to July 1. Areas in southwest Manitoba, including Virden and Brandon could see up to 175 millimetres of rain during this time.\n\nIf you are in the affected area, be watchful as local waterways are expected to rise quickly and may cause flooding. There is a potential for overland flooding in low lying areas. Do not attempt to cross fast flowing waters or waters of unknown depth. Use caution when driving on all roads as road conditions may have changed. Avoid flooded areas. Follow all directions by local authorities, listen for updates and take all necessary precautions to stay safe. Stay tuned to local media for updates.<br>Expires: 2020-07-02T16:00:00-05:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Manitoba Emergency Measures Organization, 2020-06-28T14:46:14-05:00, E0C254F4-F9A3-0CC2-58B8-5A988B33989E<br>Area: Southwestern, Western and Central Manitoba",
