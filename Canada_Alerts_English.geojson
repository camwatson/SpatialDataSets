This will result in total snowfall accumulations of 10 to 15 cm by this evening. \n\nLocal total snowfall amounts of 15 to 20 cm are possible near the Minnesota Border. However in general, the criterion for snowfall warning is not expected to be reached across Northwestern Ontario.\n\nStrong easterly winds with gusts to 60 km/h will also generate occasional blowing snow giving reduced visibilities.\n\nHazardous winter driving conditions due to low visibility in occasional heavy snow and blowing snow, and accumulating snow on untreated roads are expected. \n\nThe heaviest snowfall associated with this Colorado Low will remain south of the international border where Winter Storm Warnings are in effect.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Spring snow expected for many southern mountain passes on Saturday.\n\nA Pacific frontal system will move across southern BC on Saturday. Snow will develop over the highway passes beginning early in the morning. Initially, snow levels will be near 800 metres and gradually rise to 1200 metres that afternoon. \n\nNear the Coquihalla summit and the Kootenay Pass, 10 to 15 cm of snow can be expected by Saturday afternoon. Additional amounts of 5 to 10 cm are possible Saturday night as convective flurries develop in the wake of the front.\n\nSnowfall over other southern BC highway passes will be less intense and total amounts nearer 5 cm can be expected on Saturday.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Active weather for Newfoundland next week.\n\nMeteorologists are monitoring a developing weather system that appears set to affect the Island for the first half of next week. While it is too soon to provide specific details, indications point toward a prolonged event with strong winds and a variety of precipitation types.\n\nPrecipitation will likely arrive over southwestern Newfoundland on Monday morning and spread across the Island during the day. It appears most areas will receive snow on the leading edge of the system before a transition through freezing rain to rain. Over northern Newfoundland, however, precipitation may remain as mainly snow. Some temporary improvement can be expected during the day on Tuesday, but colder air will follow from west to east Tuesday night into Wednesday, changing precipitation back to snow, with potential for accumulation.\n\nStrong easterly winds will develop over most areas on Monday and continue through Monday night before easing on Tuesday. Gusty northerly winds will then likely follow for Tuesday night into Wednesday. The northerlies should subside Wednesday night as the system finally pulls away.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
