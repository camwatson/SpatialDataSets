				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\n\n###\n\nStrong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to PEstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #PEStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-07-15T05:02:31-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-14T22:36:31-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0852705358.2019<br>Area: Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I.",

Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to NSstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #NSStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-07-15T05:02:33-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-14T23:45:33-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2118141069.2019<br>Area: Îles-de-la-Madeleine",
