				"Summary" : "Description: A disturbance tracking northeastward across Hudson Bay will bring wet snow and strong winds to the Kimmirut region. \n\nFlurries, already in the region today, could produce a few centimetres of snow. However tonight, as the system approaches the Hudson Strait, the snow will become more organized. Snowfall accumulations of 5 to 10 cm will be possible although amounts will be highly dependent on surface temperatures and whether the snow becomes mixed with rain. A few more centimetres of wet snow are possible on Tuesday before gradually tapering off late in the day. \n\nIn addition to the snow, strong southeasterly winds will also develop tonight, gusting at times to 70 km/h, before moderating Tuesday afternoon.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
