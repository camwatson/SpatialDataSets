Significant snowfall accumulations of 20 cm or more are anticipated overnight through Sunday at higher elevations of the Alaska Highway between Fort Nelson and Watson Lake and to the south of Fort Nelson. Significant snowfall accumulations are not expected in Fort Nelson because any snow that does fall will be too wet.

Rain forecast over the region today will change over to snow at times heavy this evening as temperatures quickly approach the freezing mark. Significant snowfall accumulations of 20 cm or more are anticipated overnight through Sunday at higher elevations of the Alaska Highway between Fort Nelson and Watson Lake and to the south of Fort Nelson. Significant snowfall accumulations are not expected in Fort Nelson because any snow that does fall will be too wet. The heavy snow is forecast to end by Monday morning.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Heavy snowfall accumulation may cause tree branches to break.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
