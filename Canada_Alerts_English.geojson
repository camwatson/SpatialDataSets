At this time, it looks as if conditions will begin to improve in some areas on Saturday, but may continue in other areas into Sunday.  Further details will be provided in subsequent messages, as it is too soon to accurately forecast amounts and duration of precipitation due to uncertainty.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
