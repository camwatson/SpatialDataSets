Some inland areas may receive total freezing rain accumulations of 20 mm or more from this event.  \n\nIn addition, higher than normal water levels are likely along the Atlantic coast near high tide this evening.\n\nStrong southwesterly winds will develop this evening and then diminish somewhat as they shift to northwesterly overnight, as a cold front crossing the province brings snow flurries and a rapid drop to colder temperatures.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and extremely hazardous.
