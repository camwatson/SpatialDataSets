These winds will generate blowing snow with near zero visibility near the Richardson Mountains.\n\nBlizzard conditions are expected to end late Sunday night as the winds diminish.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be extremely hazardous due to reduced visibility. Road closures are likely.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
