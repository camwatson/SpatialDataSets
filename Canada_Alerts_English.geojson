Accumulations will likely be in the 2 to 4 cm range and will be limited somewhat by melting and compaction. \n\nThe snow also continues in Naujaat today, and will continue to be heavier through today, tonight and even into Sunday. The snow may start to mix with rain overnight or on Sunday after which time further accumulations will be limited. Total snowfall accumulations at Naujaat this weekend will likely end up in the 20 to 30 cm range. In addition to the snow, strong southeast winds will gust to 60 or 70 km/h, creating blowing snow at times.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The winds will gradually ease on Saturday night.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be extremely hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least 4 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
