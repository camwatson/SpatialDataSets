				"Summary" : "Description: Freezing rain likely on Friday.\n\nFreezing rain is forecast to begin late Friday afternoon or early Friday evening over parts of southwestern Ontario and the Golden Horseshoe.  Freezing rain may be mixed initially with rain or snow.  A potential prolonged period of freezing rain could bring measurable ice accumulations to many areas.  The freezing rain should transition to rain or snow later Friday night.\n\nThis precipitation is associated with a low pressure system moving north from Texas.  There is still some uncertainty with the exact track of the system as it approaches Lake Erie, which will affect the exact timing and duration of the freezing rain.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are likely to be issued as the event draws closer.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
