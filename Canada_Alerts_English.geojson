				"Summary" : "Description: A Flood Advisory has now been issued by the Alberta River Forecast Centre for Lac Ste. Anne County.  Rapid snow melt has resulted in a very rapid rise in the water levels of both the Little Paddle and Paddle Rivers. Paddle River dykes are over topping in areas.  This is in addition to the Spring Runoff Advisory for overland flooding in other areas of Lac Ste. Anne County.\n###\nResidents and the travelling public may encounter high water levels in roadside ditches, and water encroaching or crossing roadways.  The County has been actively steaming blocked culverts, and continues to respond to other areas of concern, to assist in the release of water to reduce hazardous conditions and prevent damage to roadway infrastructure as quickly as possible. Residents along the Little Paddle and Paddle Rivers will see additional overland flooding of low lying areas as large amounts of snow still remains in the western and northern portions of these river basins.  Agricultural operations should consider moving livestock and equipment to higher ground at this time.<br>Expires: 2020-04-25T14:50:08-06:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Lac Ste.
