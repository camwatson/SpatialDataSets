				"Summary" : "Description: Spring is on hold, and central Albertans are encouraged to remain home. \n\nHeavy snow will begin this evening, with total accumulations of 10 to 15 cm possible by Tuesday morning. \n\nA moisture-rich weather system will move across the province tonight. It is likely that this storm will produce significant snowfall over much of east-central Alberta. At this time, the greatest confidence in the highest accumulations is for areas east of the city of Edmonton. However, there remains a moderate likelihood of at least 10 cm falling elsewhere. \n\nOnce there is increased certainty on forecast amounts more regions may be added to the snowfall warning in effect.\n\nTemperatures will be well below normal this week.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
