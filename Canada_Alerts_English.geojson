Heavy rain is also likely with these storms.\n\nWidespread rainfall will accompany the low pressure system Saturday night and Sunday, and will cause local rivers to rise.\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada meteorologists will continue to monitor the situation.\n\nFor more information on river flow forecasts, and flood warning and advisories, please visit the BC River Forecast Centre website at http://bcrfc.env.gov.bc.ca/warnings/index.htm\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Frost is possible across much of the region tonight, although will be most likely in the southern Interlake into southeastern Manitoba.\n\nIn the Red River Valley, temperatures will remain warmest near the western escarpment where lows will likely fall to the 0 to +1C range.

In Winnipeg, frost is likely in open and outlying regions, however areas closer to the core will likely remain above freezing.\n\nEven in areas that will generally remain above freezing across southern Manitoba, isolated patches of frost will be possible in low-lying areas or areas cold air drainage.\n\nTemperatures will recover early Saturday morning, followed by a general warming trend over the coming days.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
