				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nA fast moving low pressure system tracking across eastern Saskatchewan into west central Manitoba is supporting scattered thunderstorms this evening.  Some of these thunderstorms could briefly reach severe thresholds.  \n\nThe severe thunderstorm threat will diminish late this evening as the low pressure system continues to track southeastwards across central and southern Manitoba.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: For Tropical Depression Erin.\n\nThe next information statement will be issued by 03:00 a.m. ADT.\n\nTropical Depression Erin is tracking northeastward toward the Maritimes. Erin is expected to transition to a post-tropical system well before it reaches southwestern Nova Scotia later Thursday evening. Erin will bring heavy rain to much of the region beginning Thursday and strong, gusty winds with its passage Thursday night into Friday morning.\n\n1. Summary of basic information at 09:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: Near 34.9 North 72.6 West.\n\nAbout distance 270 kilometres east of Cape Hatteras NC.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 56 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: North-northeast at 33 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 1003 millibars.\n\n2. Public weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nTropical Depression Erin is expected to transition to a post-tropical system by the time it enters Canadian waters on Thursday. Rain associated with a trough of low pressure approaching from the west will spread over the western Maritimes early Thursday morning. As Erin approaches later on Thursday, some of its moisture will feed into this trough and likely enhance the rain intensity associated with it. The heavier rain and strongest winds associated directly with post-tropical Erin should reach the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia later Thursday evening. \n\na. Wind.\n\nSome gusty winds will likely accompany post-tropical Erin, especially to those areas just to the right of its track early Friday morning. At this time it is not expected that these winds will reach warning criteria (i.e. gusts to 90 km/h or higher), but could still be strong enough to cause isolated power outages and minor damage, especially given that trees are still in full leaf.\n\nb. Rainfall.\n\nThe combination of Post-Tropical Erin and its interaction with the trough of low pressure crossing the region on Thursday will combine to produce significant rainfall.  Rainfall will likely meet or exceed warning criteria (50 mm or more in 24 hours) in parts of the Maritimes, especially those areas just north and west of Erin's track. Some isolated locations in these areas could possibly see total rainfall amounts in excess of 100 mm before the rain ends later Friday morning.\n\nc. Surge/Waves.\n\nAt this time, warning level storm surge and coastal impacts from high waves are not expected. After midnight into Friday morning, waves near 4 metres will spread from west to east along the Atlantic Coast of Nova Scotia and will break higher along the beaches. Rip currents will also be an issue, and the public should exercise caution near the coast.\n \n3. Marine weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nGale warnings are in effect for the southwestern Maritimes marine waters, where gale force southerlies up to 35 knots are expected by Thursday evening.  These gale warnings will likely be extended to adjacent marine areas for Friday near and along Erin's path through Canadian waters.\n\nForecaster(s): Borgel/Mercer\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-08-30T05:48:31-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-08-28T23:49:31-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2158267407.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Kouchibouguac National Park, Fundy National Park, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I.",

Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles.

				"Summary" : "Description: Tropical system Erin or its remnants will approach western Nova Scotia Thursday evening and then track into the Gulf of St. Lawrence Friday morning. Rain at times heavy and gusty winds are expected across most of Nova Scotia as it moves through. Total rainfall amounts of up to 60 millimetres are possible, with the heaviest rain expected northwest of Erin's track. Lesser amounts are expected across eastern areas of the province. Southeasterly wind gusts to 60 or 70 km/h are also possible.   \n\nAt this time, warning level storm surge and coastal impacts from high waves are not expected. After midnight into Friday morning, waves near 4 metres will spread from west to east along the Atlantic Coast of Nova Scotia and will break higher along the beaches. Rip currents will also be an issue, and the public should exercise caution near the coast.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
