				"Summary" : "Description: High levels of air pollution due to smoke from forest fires will continue into tonight. \n\nSmoke plumes are moving over the region from several forest fires located in the Sandy Lake - Pikangikum region. Light northerly winds from last night have resulted in the smoke plumes affecting areas to the south and southeast of these fires. Winds will become light southwesterly tonight which will direct smoke plumes to the northeast and east. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\nThese smoke plumes will continue to affect the region tonight and Monday morning. For communities north and east of the Sandy Lake - Pikangikum region the plumes will continue through the day Monday. \n\nIf you, or someone in your care, develop symptoms, reduce or reschedule strenuous outdoors activities where ever possible until the air quality improves.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-08T12:20:04-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-07T20:21:04-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.4037665260.2019<br>Area: Attawapiskat, Sachigo Lake - Bearskin Lake, Big Trout Lake - Kasabonika, Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake, Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell, Summer Beaver - Wunnummin Lake - Kingfisher Lake, Pickle Lake - Cat Lake, Webequie, Fort Hope - Lansdowne House - Ogoki, Red Lake - Woodland Caribou Park, Ear Falls - Perrault Falls - Western Lac Seul, Savant Lake - Sturgeon Lake, Sioux Lookout - Eastern Lac Seul, Kenora - Grassy Narrows - Whitedog, Sioux Narrows - Nestor Falls - Morson, Dryden - Vermilion Bay, Ignace - English River, Fort Frances - Emo - Rainy River, Seine River Village - Mine Centre, Armstrong - Auden - Wabakimi Park, Gull Bay - Black Sturgeon Lake, Upsala - Raith, Atikokan - Shebandowan - Quetico Park, Cloud Bay - Dorion, Kakabeka Falls - Whitefish Lake - Arrow Lake",

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from forest fires over eastern Manitoba and northwestern Ontario continues to linger over eastern portions of the province. Southerly winds have however redirected the smoke away from the western Red River valley and Winnipeg and brought an improvement in air quality to these regions. \n\nThe air quality is expected to improve this evening and overnight over southeastern Manitoba as the southerly winds continue to push the smoke to the north. Communities closer to the fires and Ontario border, such as Little Grand Rapids and Bissett, may still experience poor air quality through tonight and into Monday.\n\nThese same winds will begin to push the smoke into northeastern Manitoba tonight. This smoke will linger through the day Monday and likely into Monday night.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nDue to the smoky conditions, individuals living in or travelling to the above noted areas are advised to be aware of potential health concerns that can be associated with current air conditions. In these current conditions, even healthy individuals may experience sore eyes, tears, coughing and a runny nose.\n\nIn areas affected by smoke from wildland fires, Manitobans are encouraged to:\n- limit outdoor activity and/or strenuous physical activity; if breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce the activity\n- reduce exposure to smoke by staying indoors or moving to areas with cleaner air, as conditions can vary dramatically by area\n- turn off furnaces and air-conditioning units that may draw smoke indoors\n- keep indoor air cleaner by avoiding smoking or burning other materials \n\nPeople at higher risk include young children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with heart or lung conditions (particularly asthma), and therefore should avoid as much exposure to smoke as possible.\n\nManitobans with health questions or concerns can contact their health-care provider or call Health Links – Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257. More information on the health effects of smoke is available at www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/smoke.html.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-08T13:52:05-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Manitoba Health, 2019-07-07T21:53:05-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3546721591.2019<br>Area: R.M. of St. Clements incl.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions will be favourable for the development of funnel clouds today.\n\n\n###\n\nThese types of funnel clouds are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nIf conditions become more favourable for the development of landspout tornadoes, watches and warnings will be issued by Environment Canada.\n\nLandspout tornadoes do not usually cause significant damage but can still be dangerous. They can be strong enough to topple trees, damage roofs or toss debris short distances.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Elevated pollution levels are expected or occurring.\n\nAIR QUALITY ADVISORY FOR YUKON\n\nThe office of the Yukon Chief Medical Officer of Health has issued an Air Quality Advisory for all Yukon communities due to high or increasing concentrations of wildfire smoke.\n\nWildfires in Alaska and central Yukon are causing increased concentrations of smoke throughout the territory. Local conditions may also affect the concentration of smoke in each community.  Please note that there is no immediate wildfire threat to any Yukon communities.\n\nSmoke can impact your health if it lingers in your community. Please observe the following recommendations: \n\n- You may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, eye or throat irritation, or shortness of breath. If you are experiencing symptoms, limit outdoor activity and/or strenuous physical activity; if breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce the activity.\n\n-\tMake sure you identify and support those who are at increased risk from wildfire smoke. These include small children, elders, pregnant women, and those with lung or heart disease.\n\n-\tIf you have a health condition that could worsen with the smoke (asthma, chronic lung disease or COPD, or heart disease) check in with your health care provider to make sure that you have a plan for managing your condition. Make sure your medications and supplies are available and up-to-date. \n\n-\tReduce exposure to smoky air by staying indoors and turning on an air cleaner with a HEPA filter, if you have one. Keep indoor air as clean as possible by avoiding smoking or burning other materials.\n\n-\tIf your symptoms worsen or you are concerned about your health or the health of a friend/family member, contact the health line at 811, contact your health care provider, or go to your Community Health Centre or hospital emergency department.\n\n-\tFor advice about keeping your home air clean and cool visit www.hss.gov.yk.ca/wildfiresmoke.php\n\n-\tTo view an hourly forecast of smoke conditions in Yukon, visit www.firesmoke.ca/forecasts/current\n\n###\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-08T12:13:51-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Government of Yukon, 2019-07-07T20:14:51-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1225626675.2019<br>Area: Dawson, Mayo, Beaver Creek, Pelly - Carmacks, Kluane Lake, Haines Junction, Whitehorse, Teslin Y.T., Cassiar Mountains Y.T., Watson Lake Y.T., Faro - Ross River, Dempster, Old Crow",

				"Summary" : "Description: Elevated pollution levels are expected or occurring.\n\nSmoke from forest fires over eastern Manitoba and northwestern Ontario continues to linger over eastern portions of the province. Southerly winds have however redirected the smoke away from the western Red River valley and Winnipeg and brought an improvement in air quality to these regions. \n\nThe air quality is expected to improve this evening and overnight over southeastern Manitoba as the southerly winds continue to push the smoke to the north. Communities closer to the fires and Ontario border, such as Little Grand Rapids and Bissett, may still experience poor air quality through tonight and into Monday.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nDue to the smoky conditions, individuals living in or travelling to the above noted areas are advised to be aware of potential health concerns that can be associated with current air conditions. In these current conditions, even healthy individuals may experience sore eyes, tears, coughing and a runny nose.\n\nIn areas affected by smoke from wildland fires, Manitobans are encouraged to:\n- limit outdoor activity and/or strenuous physical activity; if breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce the activity\n- reduce exposure to smoke by staying indoors or moving to areas with cleaner air, as conditions can vary dramatically by area\n- turn off furnaces and air-conditioning units that may draw smoke indoors\n- keep indoor air cleaner by avoiding smoking or burning other materials \n\nPeople at higher risk include young children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with heart or lung conditions (particularly asthma), and therefore should avoid as much exposure to smoke as possible.\n\nManitobans with health questions or concerns can contact their health-care provider or call Health Links – Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257. More information on the health effects of smoke is available at www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/smoke.html.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-08T11:52:53-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Manitoba Health, 2019-07-07T19:53:53-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0787601684.2019<br>Area: R.M. of St. Clements incl.
