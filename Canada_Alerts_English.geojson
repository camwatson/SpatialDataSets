Coastal areas will see the precipitation begin as rain or a rain and snow mix tonight which will result in lower snowfall amounts in these areas at first.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nSnowfall warnings are issued when significant snowfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
