Dorian will make landfall near Halifax Saturday evening then move into the eastern Gulf of St. Lawrence on Sunday as a powerful post-tropical storm. Strong winds associated with Dorian will gust up to 90 km/h Saturday night.\n\n###\n\nThese winds could break tree branches potentially resulting in downed utility lines.\n\nA tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds near 65 km/h or more) are expected over parts of the region within 24 hours.\n\nBy nature, a tropical storm also implies the threat of local flooding from heavy rainfall - consult your local area forecast for possible rainfall warnings.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The current track has Dorian moving near Halifax Saturday night. Winds will increase throughout the day Saturday and will become severe by the evening. Wind gusts up to 150 km/h are now likely, especially along coastal areas.\n\nFlooding is also possible along parts of the coast due to storm surge and rough pounding surf later on Saturday.\n\n###\n\nThese winds will topple many trees leading to downed utility lines and extended service outages. Moderate to significant damage to roofing materials, exterior cladding and light structures is likely. This could result in some damage to docks and breakwaters. Shoreline erosion and wave overwash is expected where winds blow onshore.\n\nA hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected over parts of the region within 24 hours. Hurricane conditions include (A) sustained winds near 120 km/h or more, and/or (B) significantly elevated water levels and dangerous surf along the coast.\n\nBy nature, a hurricane also implies the threat of local flooding from heavy rainfall - consult your local area forecast for possible rainfall warnings.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: For Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThe next information statement will be issued by 03:00 a.m. ADT.\n\nHurricane Dorian is accelerating towards Nova Scotia and will make landfall Saturday evening near Halifax. Severe winds and heavy rain for parts of Atlantic Canada and Quebec.\n\n1. Summary of basic information at 09:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: 37.8 North 71.5 West.\n\nAbout: 458 kilometres northeast of Cape Hatteras.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 148 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: northeast at 43 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 958 millibars.\n\n\n2. Public weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nA Hurricane Warning is in effect for central and eastern Nova Scotia. Hurricane Watches are in effect for southwestern Newfoundland, western Nova Scotia, eastern Prince Edward Island, and the Magdalen Islands. \n\nTropical storm warnings are in effect for southeastern New Brunswick and western Prince Edward Island. Tropical storm watches are in effect for northern and southwestern Newfoundland.\n\nAccording to the latest forecast guidance, the most likely track projection brings Hurricane Dorian south of the Maritimes on Saturday, passing near or over Halifax Saturday night, and then over the eastern Gulf of St. Lawrence waters or western Newfoundland by Sunday morning. \n\nSevere winds and torrential rain will have major impacts for southeastern New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Western Newfoundland, and the Quebec Lower North Shore, and the Magdalen Islands. Large waves are expected for the Atlantic coasts of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and for eastern portions of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Finally, storm surge, combined with large waves and pounding surf, may give flooding for parts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, the Magdalen Islands, and parts of the Quebec North Shore.\n\na. Wind.\n\nMost regions will experience tropical storm force winds of 90 to 110 km/h, beginning over southwestern Nova Scotia Saturday morning, in the afternoon over eastern Nova Scotia, and towards evening for Prince Edward Island, the Magdalen Islands, and southwestern Newfoundland. Near and to the south of the forecast track, winds will reach hurricane force of 120 km/h or more. Behind the storm, there is a possibility of storm to hurricane force northwesterlies. Wind impacts will likely be enhanced by foliage on the trees, causing broken branches and tree falls, resulting in power outages, blocking of roads, and other type of damages. \n\nHurricane force wind warnings are in effect for central and eastern Nova Scotia and eastern Prince Edward Island. Wind warnings are in effect for western and northern Nova Scotia, western Prince Edward Island, and the Magdalen Islands.\n\nb. Rainfall.\n\nRainfall will be a major factor as torrential rain will lead to flooding in some areas. The highest rainfall amounts are expected over Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and the Magdalen Islands where 50 to 100 mm are expected. Forecast guidance is also suggesting a swath in excess of 150 mm north and west of Dorian's track. Some districts have received large quantities of rain last week, and with the soil moisture still very high, excessive runoff may exacerbate the flooding potential. This combined with the severe winds may result in damage due to falling trees.\n\nRainfall warnings are in effect for Nova Scotia, western Prince Edward Island, and eastern and southern New Brunswick. \n\n\n\nc. Surge/Waves.\n\nThere will also be rough and pounding surf, especially for parts of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Waves of 7 to 10 metres will reach the Southwestern Shore of Nova Scotia on Saturday and spread to the Eastern Shore Saturday night. These waves will likely reach southern Newfoundland by Sunday morning with waves nearing 12 metres. Waves of 4 to 7 metres will impact north facing coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Note that waves will break higher along some of the coastlines, and dangerous rip currents are likely. Please exercise extreme caution. \n\nStorm surge is an issue, mainly for the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, the north coast of Prince Edward Island, southwestern Newfoundland, and the Magdalen Islands. Current guidance suggests water levels approaching inundation levels during high tide. However, when combined with rough and pounding surf, there may be flooding and overwash of waves. \n\nStorm surge warnings are in effect for the north shore of Prince Edward Island and western Cape Breton. Warnings will be extended to the Lower Quebec North Shore and Anticosti Island, as well as the Magdalen Islands.\n\n3. Marine weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nAs Dorian moves into our waters, it will spread hurricane force southeasterlies near and south of its track, over offshore Canadian waters. As the hurricane moves further into the Maritimes, storm to hurricane force northwesterlies will develop behind it. Waves of 10 to 15 metres are expected south of the storm track, beginning late Saturday over southwestern waters and approaching the south coast of Newfoundland Sunday morning. As the low continues east Sunday into Monday, waves of 4 to 7 metres will develop over eastern waters, and for the southwestern Grand Banks will build to 5 to 10 metres and will diminish to near 5 metres late in the day.\n\nHurricane force wind warnings are in effect for most Atlantic waters and storm warnings are in effect for most other waters in the Maritimes. For Newfoundland, a Storm warning is in effect for the Southwest Coast, and gales are in effect for western and southern waters.\n\n\n\nForecasters: March/Mercer/Couturier/McArthur\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-09-08T06:46:54-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-09-07T00:47:54-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1650474324.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Fredericton and Southern York County, Oromocto and Sunbury County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Stanley - Doaktown - Blackville Area, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Kouchibouguac National Park, Fundy National Park, Miramichi and area, Acadian Peninsula, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I., Avalon Peninsula North, Avalon Peninsula Southeast, St. John's and vicinity, Avalon Peninsula Southwest, Burin Peninsula, Connaigre, Burgeo - Ramea, Channel-Port aux Basques and vicinity, Corner Brook and vicinity, Deer Lake - Humber Valley, Gros Morne, Bay St. George, Buchans and the interior, Grand Falls-Windsor and vicinity, Bay of Exploits, Bonavista North, Bonavista Peninsula, Clarenville and vicinity, Gander and vicinity, Green Bay - White Bay, Terra Nova, Northern Peninsula East, Parson's Pond - Hawke's Bay, Port Saunders and the Straits, Red Bay to L'Anse-au-Clair, Norman Bay to Lodge Bay, Cartwright to Black Tickle, Eagle River, Chevery, Blanc-Sablon, Anticosti, Îles-de-la-Madeleine",
