				"Summary" : "Description: At 12:40 p.m. CDT, Environment Canada meteorologists are tracking an area of severe thunderstorms capable of producing very strong wind gusts, nickel to ping pong ball size hail and heavy rain.\n\nThis area is centred around St. Eustache and is moving to the east.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Fast-moving water across a road can sweep a vehicle away. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2020-07-23T20:29:51-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-23T17:41:51-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3076208604.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Portage la Prairie incl.
