Children, seniors and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk. If you, or someone in your care, develop symptoms, reduce strenuous outdoors activities where ever possible until the air quality improves.\n\nWhen outdoors, if your breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce strenuous physical activities. If you experience irritation of eyes, nose or throat, shortness of breath or other respiratory symptoms, you should take action to reduce your exposure to smoke. \n\nIf you are feeling unwell and experiencing symptoms, contact your health care provider for advice.\n\nIssued jointly by Environment Canada and the Northwest Territories Departments of Environment and Natural Resources and Health and Social Services.\n\nFor more information on air quality and your health, please visit the Northwest Territories Department of Health and Social Services at www.hss.gov.nt.ca/en/services/environmental-health/air-quality.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-08-04T19:18:54-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Northwest Territories Departments of Environment and Natural Resources and Health and Social Services, 2019-08-04T03:19:54-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1060747295.2019<br>Area: Wrigley Region",
