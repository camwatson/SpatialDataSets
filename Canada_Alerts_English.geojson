The onshore winds also have the potential to produce local snow squalls tonight and Tuesday. These strong winds will combine with fresh snowfall to cause reduced visibility in blowing snow.\n\nConditions will improve for most areas Tuesday evening.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
