Most southern highway passes are forecast to receive about 2 to 5 cm of wet snow this morning with a locally higher amount up to 10 cm possible over the Okanagan Connector.  \n\nOver northern BC, the Alaska Highway (Highway 97) from the Rocky Mountain foothills to the Liard River can also expect flurries this morning.\n\nPrecipitation will change back to rain near noon as the airmass begins to warm.\n\nMotorists and those venturing outdoors are encouraged to be prepared for winter-like conditions.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Most southern highway passes are forecast to receive about 2 to 5 cm of wet snow this morning with a locally higher amount up to 10 cm possible over the Okanagan Connector.  \n\nOver northern BC, the Alaska Highway (Highway 97) from the Rocky Mountain foothills to the Liard River can also expect flurries this morning.\n\nPrecipitation will change back to rain near noon as the airmass begins to warm.\n\nMotorists and those venturing outdoors are encouraged to be prepared for winter-like conditions.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

This threat of thunderstorms will continue throughout the night as the system starts to tap into hot and humid air originating from the Dakotas. The threat for severe thunderstorms will diminish during the early morning hours.\n\n###\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
