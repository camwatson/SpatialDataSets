				"Summary" : "Description: A strong Pacific storm is on the way for Thursday afternoon and Friday for the BC coast.\n\nThe storm will approach the coast on Thursday. Precipitation spreads onto Vancouver Island late on Thursday morning and onto the south coast early Thursday afternoon. Strong southeasterly winds will also develop on Thursday afternoon.\n\nInitially temperatures will be cold enough to allow some of the precipitation to start as wet snow over higher elevations of Vancouver Island and the south coast. \n\nBy Thursday evening warm air accompanying the storm will drive freezing levels and temperatures higher so that precipitation changes to rain for most communities. The exception may be Whistler and the Sea to Sky Highway from Squamish to Whistler where snow could persist longer.\n\nThe heavy rain and strong winds continue all day on Friday. The highest rainfall amounts will be over the central coast, north and west Vancouver Island. Areas of Squamish, northern sections of Metro Vancouver, and the Fraser Valley will also significant amounts of rainfall.\n\nIn areas where snow does accumulate, a higher chance of localized flooding is possible due to rain on snow.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
