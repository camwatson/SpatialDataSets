An area of rain turning to freezing rain is expected to develop this evening in the southern Brochet, southern Tadoule , and northern Thompson regions and then spread into the Gillam and Shamattawa regions tonight. Depending on overnight temperatures, parts of Lynn Lake region may see some freezing rain tonight and early Friday. \n\nFreezing rain amounts of 5 to 10 mm are expected. Some areas in these regions may receive accumulating snow. Easterly winds gusting to 50 to 60 km/h are also forecast. \n\nThis freezing rain will continue through Friday and may push through the Churchill area Friday night.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
