Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted. Exposure is particularly a concern for infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nChildren, including teenagers, are at higher risk from outdoor air pollution because they often spend time being active outdoors. Young people are more likely to have asthma and their lungs are still developing.\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-04-02T06:19:03-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

This advisory remains in effect until further notice.\n\nExposure to PM 2.5 is particularily a concern for infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.  Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted.

Snow or rain is likely to begin Wednesday morning over southwestern New Brunswick and then spread quickly across the province by noon. At this time, southern New Brunswick will likely see significant amounts of rain, likely in excess of 25 mm. Central, eastern and northeastern New Brunswick  will likely see snow or snow mixed with rain, with amounts in excess of 15 cm or more in some areas. Northwestern New Brunswick will likely only receive light amounts of precipitation from this system. \n\nThere is considerable uncertainty in the exact location of the rain/snow boundary, as a slight shift in track or intensity of this system could significantly affect both the amounts and type of precipitation received.  \n\nPrecipitation will end Wednesday evening as the low tracks by to the southeast of the province.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Rain associated with the low will likely spread across Prince Edward Island later Wednesday morning and will fall heavy at times during the day and persist until ending Wednesday night.  Parts of Prince county could see the rain mix with or change to snow for a time later in the day.  Total rainfall amounts in excess of 25 millimetres are possible across most of the Island. These amounts combined with the heavy rates of rainfall could lead to ponding and risk of localized flooding, especially given the ground remains at least partially frozen in some areas of the province.\n\nThe rain will be accompanied by strong and gusty southeasterly winds, shifting to strong northwesterly winds Wednesday night.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
