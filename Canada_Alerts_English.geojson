				"Summary" : "Description: More rain today follows a very wet Friday.\n\nModerate to heavy rain has developed over southwestern Manitoba this morning and will gradually spread eastwards through the day today. Rainfall accumulations through Saturday evening will likely be in the 20 to 50 mm range for most areas. Many areas across southern Manitoba have already seen 50 to 100 mm of rain since Thursday night.\n\nToday's rainfall will have many convective elements which means that within the area of rain there will be embedded areas with much higher rainfall intensities. These features develop and dissipate over short periods of time and impact on a more local scale. Depending on exactly where these develop, some localized areas could see higher accumulations in the 50 to 75 mm range from Saturday morning to the time the rain tapers off later tonight.\n\nSome areas may end up with 3 day rainfall accumulations approaching 175 to 200 mm should these more intense areas of rain develop over regions that have already been hit hard by the previous storms that have moved through the province.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
