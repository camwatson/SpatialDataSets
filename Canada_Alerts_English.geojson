This squall is capable of producing quick accumulations of 2 to 5 cm in an hour along with sudden reductions to near zero visibility in heavy snow.\n\nThis band is expected to move out the region by early this evening.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nSnow squall warnings are issued when bands of snow form that produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
