				"Summary" : "Description: A prolonged period of hot weather continues.\n\nDaytime high temperatures in excess of 30 degrees Celsius, with humidex values in the high thirties to low forties, are expected this week. Overnight lows near 20 degrees Celsius are also expected through this period, providing little relief from the heat.\n\nA slightly cooler airmass may move into the area this weekend, however there is considerable uncertainty and the conditions may persist for a few areas into Saturday.\n\nPlease refer to your public forecast for further details on expected temperatures.\n\nHot and humid air can also bring deteriorating air quality and can result in the Air Quality Health Index approaching the high risk category.\n\nNever leave people or pets inside a parked vehicle.\n\n###\n\nExtreme heat affects everyone.\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nWatch for the effects of heat illness: swelling, rash, cramps, fainting, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and the worsening of some health conditions.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Temperatures will exceed the 30-degree mark during the day and will not fall below 18 degrees at night. Combined values of the temperature and the humidity will give a humidex value of 40.  \n\nThese conditions are likely to persist into Saturday.  \n\nDuring times of high heat, your health and the health of your family and friends can deteriorate rapidly.  \n\nThe ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux du Québec, in cooperation with Environment and Climate Change Canada, recommends that you protect yourself from the effects of the heat by taking the following actions:  \n\nDrink 6 to 8 glasses of water per day. As appropriate, follow your physician's instructions regarding the amount of fluid to drink; Avoid alcoholic beverages; Spend at least 2 hours a day in an air conditioned or cool place; Take at least one cool shower or bath per day, or cool your skin several times per day with wet towels; Limit physical activity; Wear light clothes.  \n\nBe sure to: \nNever leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle or a poorly ventilated room, even for a few minutes; Check on your loved ones, especially those who are vulnerable or living alone.  \n\nIf you have any questions regarding your health, call Info-Santé by dialing 8-1-1 or ask a health care provider. In case of emergency, call 9-1-1.  \n\nFor more information, visit the Government of Quebec's Portail santé mieux-être at www.sante.gouv.qc.ca.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A period of hot weather continues.\n\nDaytime high temperatures in excess of 30 degrees Celsius, with humidex values in the high thirties to low forties, are expected. Overnight lows near 20 degrees Celsius are also expected through this period, providing little relief from the heat.\n\nA slightly cooler airmass may move into the area this weekend, however there is considerable uncertainty. A few areas towards eastern Ontario are likely to experience extreme heat and high humidex values on Saturday as well.\n\nPlease refer to your public forecast for further details on expected temperatures.\n\nHot and humid air can also bring deteriorating air quality and can result in the Air Quality Health Index approaching the high risk category.\n\n###\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
