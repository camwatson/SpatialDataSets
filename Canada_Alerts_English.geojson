				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts and large hail.\n\nWith an approaching upper disturbance and recent heat and moisture in the watch area, conditions are allowing for the development of severe thunderstorms this afternoon and evening in central SK and central/southern MB. This watch area will likely be extended as the situation develops this afternoon and into this evening.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Locally heavy rain is also possible. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
