Expect strong winds and visibility frequently near zero in snow and blowing snow.\n\nAn approaching Pacific storm will spread snow to the region tonight. At the same time, the approaching system will also increase the draw of cold air out from the interior resulting in very strong outflow winds through the inlets and valleys. This combination will result in near zero visibility in blowing snow and extreme wind chill values.\n\nBlizzard conditions will continue into Saturday. The strong outflow winds are expected to moderate Saturday afternoon for Terrace, and Saturday evening over Kitimat. However, periods of heavy snow will continue into Sunday.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be extremely hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least 4 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
