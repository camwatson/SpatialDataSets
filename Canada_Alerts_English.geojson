				"Summary" : "Description: An intense low pressure system will move across the province of Quebec this weekend.   This storm will bring significant snow, strong winds, blowing snow and a risk of freezing rain over several areas of Eastern Quebec Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, snowfall warnings associated with this system have already been issued over the eastern portion of the Eastern Townships and over higher grounds of the Chaudière-Appalaches region where near 25 cm of snow are expected from Saturday evening to Sunday.   Similar amounts are possible over the Lower St Lawrence, the Gaspé Peninsula and the Lower North Shore Sunday.\n\nThese poor weather conditions may have a significant impact on travel. Be prepared for changing road conditions that could deteriorate rapidly in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nFuture weather statements will provide more details as the low pressure system's track as well as precipitation types and amounts become more certain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
