				"Summary" : "Description: Temperatures reaching 30 degrees Celsius combined with overnight lows near 18 degrees Celsius are expected for the next 3 days.\n\nA warm and increasingly humid airmass continues to push into the Maritimes and will persist until late Wednesday or early Thursday.\n\nDaytime highs over inland areas of mainland Nova Scotia are forecast to reach 30 C to 32 C on Tuesday and 30 on Wednesday, with overnight lows near 18 C providing little relief. Humidex values are expected to reach up to 39 on Tuesday and near 36 on Wednesday. \n\nDaytime highs over inland areas of Cape Breton are forecast to reach 29 C on Tuesday and Wednesday with overnight lows near 18 C. Humidex values are expected to reach up to 36 on Tuesday and Wednesday. \n\nTemperatures across the province should cool down somewhat early on Thursday as a trough of low pressure moves in from the northwest.\n\n###\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nInformation is provided on the Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness website at https://novascotia.ca/heat-related-illness/.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
