Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Where appropriate, maintain physical distancing. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce particulate matter exposure. \n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-01-11T04:58:51-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.
