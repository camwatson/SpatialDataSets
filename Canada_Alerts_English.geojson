				"Summary" : "Description: ROAD DUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR BURNS LAKE\n\n(March 16, 2020 - Smithers) The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Northern Health has issued a Road Dust Advisory for Burns Lake because of high concentrations of coarse particulate matter that are expected to persist until there is precipitation or dust suppression.  Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted.  Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at  https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-03-17T22:33:07-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

Under the snow squall, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to QCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #QCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-03-18T00:15:53-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-03-17T08:15:53-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1664637495.2020<br>Area: Joutel - Matagami area, Miquelon - Desmaraisville area, La Sarre area, Amos area, Lebel-sur-Quévillon area, Senneterre area, Rouyn area, Malartic area, Val d'Or - Louvicourt area, Dorval Lodge area, Le Domaine area, Mont-Laurier area, La Minerve - Rouge River area, Saint-Michel-des-Saints area, Saint-Donat - Mont-Tremblant Park area, Louiseville area, Matawin - Mauricie National Park area, Lac-aux-Sables area, Shawinigan area, Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade area, Trois-Rivières area, Portneuf area, Valcartier - Stoneham area, Québec area, Côte-de-Beaupré - L'Île d'Orléans area, Chibougamau, Gouin Reservoir area, Parent area, Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve area, Normandin - Péribonka area, Alma - Desbiens area, Saint-Félicien - Roberval area, Lake Bouchette area, La Tuque area, Falardeau - Mont-Valin area, Sainte-Rose-du-Nord area, Ville de Saguenay area, Rivière-Éternité - Petit-Saguenay area, Tadoussac - Baie-Sainte-Catherine area, La Malbaie area, Baie-Saint-Paul area, Apica Mountain area, Grands-Jardins Park area, l'Étape area",
