Current indications are that the the precipitation will fall as rain or wet snow over the region and as a result snowfall amounts are expected to be reduced. Nevertheless local accumulations of 5 cm or higher may be possible in some localities especially over the Turtle Mountains. \n\nIn addition, strong northerly winds gusting to 60 km/h may combine with the falling snow to produce reduced visibilities in blowing snow.

				"Summary" : "Description: Poor visibility in snow and blowing snow is expected or occurring in some locations.\n\nA spring storm, tracking southeastward across southern Alberta, will bring an assortment of weather to southern Saskatchewan over the weekend. \n\nIn general, the worst conditions are expected to occur south of a line stretching from Kindersley to Oxbow. In this area significant wet snowfall is expected with the highest accumulations occurring over the Cypress Hills and Assiniboia areas. Blizzard and Winter Storm warnings are currently in effect for these regions.\n\nNorth of this line, including Regina and the Trans-Canada Highway east to the Manitoba border, snowfall amounts will be significantly less. Amounts near the Trans-Canada Highway may reach 5 cm but fall dramatically as one heads north. The wet nature of the snow will make snowfall amounts highly variable. Despite the lower snowfall amounts, northerly winds in the area will aombine with the falling snow creating poor visibilities in blowing snow overnight into early Sunday morning with visibilities improving by midday.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nBlowing snow advisories are issued when winds are expected to create blowing snow giving poor visibility to 800 metres or less for at least 3 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to SKstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #SKStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-04-28T14:01:24-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-04-27T22:02:24-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3773089576.2019<br>Area: City of Regina, R.M. of McKillop including Strasbourg and Rowans Ravine Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA Spring storm continues to give heavy snow and blowing snow to southern Alberta.\n\nIn the wake of the cold front passing through this evening, expect very strong northerly winds gusting as high as 100 km/h. These strong winds combined with heavy falling snow will lead to reduced visibilities in blowing snow. Localized whiteout conditions are expected, especially in places such as the Highway 2 corridor and sections of the Trans-Canada Highway and Highway 1A near Calgary.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts of 10 to 20 cm are expected with locally higher amounts near 30 cm possible. Heavy snow and strong winds will taper off from the north overnight and into Sunday morning.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The heaviest snowfall is expected south of a line extending from Kindersley to Oxbow where total snowfall amounts of 10 to 20 cm are likely. Snowfall amounts will diminish rapidly north of this line. \n\nStrong northerly winds gusting to 70 km/h in combination with falling snow will also cause visibilities to be significantly reduced in blowing snow. Conditions are expected to improve over the Kindersley and Outlook areas Sunday morning with areas to the southeast improving in the afternoon\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total amounts of 10 to 20 cm is expected.\n\nA Spring storm over Alberta brought heavy snow to west-central regions of the province and continues to give heavy snow to southern regions.\n\nAs the storm continues to track south this evening, heavy snow will spread into more southern regions of Alberta. Snowfall totals are expected to be in the 10 to 20 cm range with locally higher amounts up to 30 cm over higher terrain.\n\nThe heavy snow will continue to taper off from the north this evening and overnight, except in the southern foothills where snow should linger into Sunday morning.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA Spring storm continues to give heavy snow and blowing snow to southern Alberta.\n\nIn the wake of the cold front passing through this evening, expect strong northerly winds gusting as high as 80 km/h. These strong winds combined with heavy falling snow will lead to reduced visibilities in blowing snow. Localized whiteout conditions are expected, especially in places such as the Highway 2 corridor and sections of the Trans-Canada Highway and Highway 1A near Calgary.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts of 10 to 20 cm are expected with locally higher amounts near 30 cm possible. Heavy snow and strong winds will taper off overnight and into Sunday morning.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Blizzard conditions with poor visibility in snow and blowing snow are expected or occurring.\n\nA Spring storm brings strong winds, heavy snow, and blowing snow to southern Alberta tonight.\n\nBlizzard conditions continue and are expected to develop over south-eastern regions this evening. Very strong winds near 70 km/h, with gusts up to 100 km/h, and heavy falling snow will give reduced visibilities with periods of whiteout conditions, including over eastern sections of the Trans-Canada Highway.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts of 10 to 20 cm are expected with locally higher amounts near 30 cm possible. Heavy snow and strong winds will taper off overnight and into Sunday morning.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least 4 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
