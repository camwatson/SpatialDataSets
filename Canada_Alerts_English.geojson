These strong winds are expected to persist until Wednesday.\n\nThese winds will produce widespread blowing snow across the region and likely result in periods of dangerous overland travel. There is some uncertainty as to whether or not a full-fledged blizzard will develop over the region, or if instead the blowing snow will be more localized in nature. The situation will continue to be assessed and blizzard warnings may be issued if needed.\n\nThe coastal Kivalliq communities should nonetheless be prepared for a multi-day period of strong northerly winds that will very likely produce, at least, periods of near-blizzard conditions from late Sunday to Wednesday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
