				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls this afternoon through tonight.\n\nLocally heavy snow squalls are forecast to develop today with the arrival of an unseasonably cold airmass. Locally heavy snowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm will be possible today. By tonight, as the winds shift to a more northwesterly direction, snow squalls will become more confined to areas east of the Blue Mountains and west of Barrie, likely impacting the communities of Collingwood and Wasaga Beach. An additional 10 to 15 cm will be possible in these areas by the time the snow squalls weaken late tonight.\n\nStrong northwesterly winds gusting up to 80 km/h will also accompany the snow squalls this afternoon and early this evening, resulting in reduced visibilities in heavy snow and blowing snow. Given the strength of the winds and falling temperatures with time, blowing snow will be common under any snow squall that forms.\n\nMotorists should be prepared for adverse winter driving conditions and adjust their travel plans accordingly.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

However, by this afternoon, locally heavy snow squalls are expected to develop with the arrival of an unseasonably cold airmass. \n\nLocally heavy snowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm are expected by the time the snow squalls weaken tonight.\n\nThe heavy snow will combine with strong northwesterly winds gusting up to 80 km/h resulting in reduced visibilities in heavy snow and blowing snow at times.\n\nMotorists should be prepared for adverse winter driving conditions and adjust their travel plans accordingly.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for brief but intense bursts of heavy snow producing near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
