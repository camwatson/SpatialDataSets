The blizzard is expected to end Wednesday morning when the snow moves out of the region, however gusty winds will cause blowing snow with reduced visibilities to persist until Wednesday evening.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least 6 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
