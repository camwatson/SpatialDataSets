				"Summary" : "Description: A period of very cold wind chills continues.\n\nA cold arctic airmass is expected to remain in place throughout the week. Wind chills will moderate daily, before falling into the minus 40 to 50 range during the overnight to morning periods. \n\nCloud cover to the south and west of High Level and Fort McMurray should keep the temperatures warmer and the wind chill above -40, but clear skies to the north and east of High Level and Fort McMurray will give much colder temperatures and wind chills.\n\n###\n\nWatch for cold related symptoms: shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle pain and weakness, numbness and colour change in fingers and toes.\n\nExtreme cold warnings are issued when very cold temperatures or wind chill creates an elevated risk to health such as frost bite and hypothermia.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

In this case the blowing snow may be the main issue, resulting in poor visibility at times. Conditions will improve overnight into early Friday.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
