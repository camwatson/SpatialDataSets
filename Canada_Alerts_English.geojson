These thunderstorms will have the potential to produce hail to the size of golf balls and wind gusts in excess of 100 km/h.\n\nThunderstorms are likely to last well into the evening hours before moving into Ontario.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
