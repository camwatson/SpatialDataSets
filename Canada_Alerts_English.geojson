				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nHeavy snow and blowing snow are forecast beginning this afternoon.\n\nSnow and freezing drizzle will move into southern Manitoba this afternoon with the snow intensifying overnight. Total snowfall accumulations will be in the 10 to 20 cm range by the time the snow begins to taper off on Saturday.  \nGusty northwest winds will develop overnight and strengthen on Saturday with gusts up to 70 km/h forecast. These winds combined with the falling snow will cause significantly reduced visibilities in blowing snow. \n\nConditions will gradually improve Saturday evening. \n\nPlease stay alert for updated bulletins as this system is still developing, and bulletins may change as the system approaches.\n\n###\n\nVisibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
