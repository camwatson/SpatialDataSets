The precipitation is expected to intensify this afternoon with a few hours of heavy snowfall likely into early evening. Some areas may  receive as much as 10 cm of snow in the span of just a few hours.\n\nThe snow will taper off later this evening. Motorists are urged to exercise caution as road conditions and visibility may be poor at times.\n\nThis is a result of a Colorado Low that will track through northeastern Ontario today.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Below seasonal temperatures to continue through the weekend.\n\nA low pressure system off Vancouver Island will move into Washington State this evening. Meanwhile, modified Arctic air will advance southward through the B.C. interior. By this afternoon,  the Arctic front is expected to reach Kamloops and pile up against the east side of the Rockies.\n\nWith a somewhat cool airmass already in place, widespread snow is expected from Bella Coola and Whistler eastward to 100 Mile and the southwest interior, and further to the Kootenays and parts of the Columbias. Snow may become mixed with rain over southern and eastern portions of this area. Currently, forecast snowfall amounts range from 5 to 15 cm.\n\nIn the wake of the low, a drying trend begins on Saturday as the Arctic air spreads through the rest of the southern interior. Temperatures of 10 degrees below seasonal normals are expected through the weekend.\n\nBe prepared to adjust your driving with changing road conditions.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: More early season snowfall expected today as Arctic air arrives. Below seasonal temperatures to continue through the weekend.\n\nA low pressure system off Vancouver Island will move into Washington State this evening. Meanwhile, modified Arctic air will advance southward through the B.C. interior. By this afternoon,  the Arctic front is expected to reach Kamloops and pile up against the east side of the Rockies.\n\nWith a somewhat cool airmass already in place, widespread snow is expected from Bella Coola and Whistler eastward to 100 Mile and the southwest interior, and further to the Kootenays and parts of the Columbias. Snow may become mixed with rain over southern and eastern portions of this area. Currently, forecast snowfall amounts range from 5 to 15 cm.\n\nIn the wake of the low, a drying trend begins on Saturday as the Arctic air spreads through the rest of the southern interior. Temperatures of 10 degrees below seasonal normals are expected through the weekend.\n\nBe prepared to adjust your driving with changing road conditions.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-10-23T23:39:52-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-10-23T07:40:52-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0464228430.2020<br>Area: Highway 3 - Paulson Summit to Kootenay Pass, Highway 97 - Clinton to 100 Mile House via Begbie Summit, Trans-Canada Highway - Eagle Pass to Rogers Pass, Sea to Sky - Squamish to Whistler",

Snow may become mixed with rain over southern and eastern portions of this area. Currently, forecast snowfall amounts range from 5 to 15 cm.\n\nIn the wake of the low, a drying trend begins on Saturday as the Arctic air spreads through the rest of the southern interior.

Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nA cold airmass combined with winds off the waters of Lake Winnipeg will create a favourable setup for snowsqualls.  \n\nOver the next few hours the winds are expected to shift to the northwest, bringing snow squalls to the eastern shores of Lake Winnipeg.\n\nSnow amounts will be highly localized but may exceed 20 to 30 cm in some areas by the time the snow squalls diminish on Saturday night.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Rapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
