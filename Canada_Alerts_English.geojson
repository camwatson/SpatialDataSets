				"Summary" : "Description: A surge of arctic air is expected to bring colder temperatures to most of Alberta today. This arctic air will begin to push eastwards into southwestern Alberta later this afternoon and help to generate a prolonged period of snowfall. The snow will continue through Wednesday and into Thursday morning. Total snowfall amounts will be from 20 to 30 cm with some localities seeing 50 or more before the snow ends on Thursday. At this time, the likely areas to see this snow will be in the Crowsnest Pass and Cardston regions but there is a risk for some higher snowfall into the Claresholm and Lethbridge regions as well. This special weather statement will likely be replaced by a snowfall warning later today.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
