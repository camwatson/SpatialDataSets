				"Summary" : "Description: Freezing rain is expected or occurring.\n\nA low in Montana is spreading an area of mixed precipitation including freezing rain to areas in southwestern Saskatchewan. \n\nThe freezing rain may accumulate quickly before moving off but surfaces will remain a slippery hazard until temperatures warm above zero.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
