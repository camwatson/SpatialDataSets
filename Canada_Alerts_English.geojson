Winds are expected to remain below wind warning criteria, but could still gust up to 80 km/h over exposed areas and along parts of the coast. A second round of strong northwesterly winds are expected on Wednesday in the wake of Teddy after it crosses eastern Nova Scotia in the morning. These northwesterly winds could potentially gust to 70 to 80 km/h as well before diminishing late in the day.\n\n###\n\nA tropical storm watch means that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds near 65 km/h or more) are possible over parts of the region within 36 hours.\n\nBy nature, a tropical storm also implies the threat of local flooding from heavy rainfall - consult your local area forecast for possible rainfall warnings.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A series of vigorous frontal systems will move across the south coast of BC  tonight through Saturday. They will bring periods of heavy rain and strong winds in the first active storm cycle of the the fall season.\n\nThe first system arrives on Vancouver Island tonight, and will spread to the mainland before Wednesday morning and continue through Thursday.\n\nRainfall intensity will vary through the day and across regions. Over Vancouver Island, total rainfall amounts over the two day period will generally range from 15 to 40 mm, with amounts in excess of 100 mm over West Vancouver Island.\n\nFor the mainland coast, total rainfall amounts will range from 30 mm to over 50 mm for the two day period. The heaviest rainfall amounts are currently expected for the North Shore.\n\nThis system will also bring strong southeast winds to the west coast of Vancouver Island tonight. As the system progresses, winds across the Strait of Georgia and surrounding regions will peak early Wednesday morning.\n\nThe combination of heavy rain with leaves on the ground may lead to localized flooding. Strong winds may also lead to power outages.\n\nThe wet pattern will continue with more rain expected Friday and Saturday.\n\nRainfall and wind warnings are now in effect for some regions, and will be updated as needed.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Tropical storm force winds ahead of now Post-Tropical Storm Teddy will continue, but are expected to remain just below wind warning criteria.\n\nPotential wind gusts: 60 to 80 km/h over exposed areas and along parts of the coast.\n\nLocations: Iles de la Madeleine and Prince Edward Island.\n\nTime span: tonight into Wednesday evening.\n \nRemarks: Strong northeasterly winds will continue tonight ahead of Post-Tropical Storm Teddy.  Winds are expected to remain below wind warning criteria, but could still gust up to 80 km/h over exposed areas and along parts of the coast. A second round of strong northwesterly winds are expected on Wednesday in the wake of Teddy after it crosses eastern Nova Scotia in the morning. These northwesterly winds could potentially gust to 70 to 80 km/h as well before diminishing late in the day.\n\n###\n\nA tropical storm watch means that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds near 65 km/h or more) are possible over parts of the region within 36 hours.\n\nBy nature, a tropical storm also implies the threat of local flooding from heavy rainfall - consult your local area forecast for possible rainfall warnings.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: For Post-tropical Storm Teddy.\n\nThe next intermediate information statement will be issued by 6:00 a.m. ADT, followed by the next full information statement at 9:00 a.m.\n\nPost-Tropical Storm Teddy continues to bring heavy rain, strong winds and heavy pounding surf to much of the Maritimes and southern Newfoundland today. The centre of Teddy is expected to make landfall along the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia this morning.\n\n1. Summary of basic information at 3:00 a.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: near 43.4 North 63.5 West.\n\nAbout 137 kilometres south of Halifax.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 120 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: north-northeast at 35 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 957 millibars.\n\nTeddy remains a powerful post-tropical storm on its approach towards eastern Nova Scotia this morning with a turn towards the north-northeast. It will continue to weaken as it travels across eastern Nova Scotia and into the southeastern Gulf of St. Lawrence late this morning. The storm will then continue to weaken further as it moves across the eastern Gulf of St. Lawrence this afternoon and towards northern Newfoundland tonight.\n\n\n2. Public impacts and warnings summary: \n\na. Wind.\nWind and Tropical Storm warnings are in effect for the Atlantic coastline of\nNova Scotia from Halifax to Cape Breton, where wind gusts of 80 to 110 km/h are occurring or expected this morning. A Tropical Storm warning is in effect for the southwest coast of Newfoundland with wind gusts of 80 to 100 km/h possible into this afternoon. Tropical storm watches remain in effect for northern Nova Scotia, as well as Prince Edward Island and Iles de la Madeleine where winds gusting 70 to 80 possibly reaching 90 km/h are possible this afternoon. Given trees are still in full leaf, these winds could cause limbs to break with some tree falls, likely leading to many power outages. A Wreckhouse wind warning remains in effect for southwestern Newfoundland where winds could gust up to 130 km/h into this evening.\n\nb. Rainfall.\nRainfall warnings are in effect for all of Nova Scotia except western most regions. Rainfall warnings are also in effect for Prince Edward Island, Les Iles de la Madeleine and parts of the south coast of Newfoundland. Rain, at times heavy, will continue for these areas today as Teddy makes landfall and continues northeast toward Newfoundland. Rainfall amounts generally of 30 to 50 mm have already fallen last night, with the exception of Victoria county in Cape Breton who has already seen 90 to 120 mm fall. With additional rainfall today, total rainfall expected remains at 50 to 75 mm, with upwards of 150 mm possible for Victoria county.\n\nc. Surge/Waves.\nStorm surge warnings are in effect along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia from Yarmouth County through to eastern Cape Breton County, as well as the southwestern coast of Newfoundland. Large swells will continue to effect the Atlantic coast this morning with waves of up to 8 to 10 metres, and will break higher along parts of the coast. \n\nElevated water levels and large waves are occurring along eastern parts of the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia this morning and will continue to develop over southwestern Newfoundland into this afternoon. There is also a chance for Prince Edward Island and Iles de la Madeleine today. \n\nThe highest risk is the combination of the very large waves combining with the storm surge to cause dangerous conditions along the Atlantic coasts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Rough and pounding surf, localised flooding and coastal infrastructure damage and erosion are likely in vulnerable areas, even outside of the times of high tide.\n\n3. Marine impacts and warning summary:\n\nHurricane force wind warnings are in effect East Scotian Slope and Sable with storm and gale warnings for remaining waters south of Nova Scotia.  Gale warnings are in effect for most Gulf of St. Lawrence waters as well as the southwestern Grand Banks. Teddy will continue to produce waves of 8 to 10 metres this morning. In addition High Water Level warnings continue to be in effect for Eastern Shore and Fourchu. \n\nThe centre of Teddy passed near Buoy 44150. Both B44150 and B44137 saw significant wave heights of 11 metres with B44137 reaching a peak wave height of 25 metres. \n\nForecaster(s): McArthur\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-09-24T04:59:39-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-09-23T05:50:39-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1414195650.2020<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I., Burin Peninsula, Connaigre, Burgeo - Ramea, Channel-Port aux Basques and vicinity, Îles-de-la-Madeleine",

Early today as Teddy approaches, eastern Nova Scotia will see very large wave and significant storm surge. Outside of the times for high tide, there is still a threat for very large waves, rough and pounding surf, and local overwash. The public should exercise extreme caution.\n\n###\n\nThis is a potentially dangerous situation. High waves combined with the surge may cause damage along the coast. Coastal flooding is possible along the shoreline.\n\nStorm surge warnings are issued when water levels pose a threat to coastal regions.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

A second swath of strong southerly winds will briefly affect eastern mainland Nova Scotia and Cape Breton early Wednesday morning.\n\nPotential wind gusts: 80 to 90 km/h possibly reaching 110 km/h over exposed areas and along parts of the coast. \n\nLocations: Coastal regions of mainland Nova Scotia and Cape Breton.\n\nTime span: this evening. A second period of strong winds can be expected over eastern Nova Scotia Wednesday morning.\n\nRemarks: Tropical storm force easterly winds are occuring over much of Nova Scotia ahead of Post-Tropical Storm Teddy.  Winds are expected to gust to 80 to 100 km/h over exposed areas and along parts of the coast this evening.  A period of very strong southerly winds gusting to 90 to 110 km/h will affect eastern mainland Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Wednesday morning as the center of Teddy crosses eastern Nova Scotia.\n\n###\n\nThese winds could break tree branches potentially resulting in downed utility lines.\n\nA tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds near 65 km/h or more) are expected over parts of the region within 24 hours.\n\nBy nature, a tropical storm also implies the threat of local flooding from heavy rainfall - consult your local area forecast for possible rainfall warnings.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
