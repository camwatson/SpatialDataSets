The heavy snow and strong winds occurring together will result in blowing snow that will significantly reduce visibilities late this afternoon and this evening. \n\nAs the cold front moves east, the heavy snow will taper to flurries late in the evening, however the winds will remain strong and could continue to whip up the freshly fallen snow. Conditions are expected to improve early Saturday morning as the winds diminish.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlowing snow advisories are issued when winds are expected to create blowing snow giving poor visibility to 800 metres or less for at least 3 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-12-19T08:18:38-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-12-18T16:18:38-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0847915306.2020<br>Area: Fort Severn, Peawanuck",

It should reach places like Big Trout Lake, Kasabonika and Kingfisher Lake later this afternoon and reach the northern Webequie region by early evening.\n\nNorthwest winds gusting to 70 km/h combined with heavy snow during the passage of the front will likely result in a brief period of very poor visibility and whiteout conditions.
