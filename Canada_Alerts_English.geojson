				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nA cold front tracking across eastern Saskatchewan and western Manitoba is triggering scattered thunderstorms this afternoon.  Some of these thunderstorms may briefly reach severe thresholds.  This severe thunderstorm watch may be expanded eastwards as the afternoon and evening progresses.\n\n###\n\nFast-moving water across a road can sweep a vehicle away. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.
