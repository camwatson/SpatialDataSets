				"Summary" : "Description: High levels of air pollution due to smoke from forest fires will continue this morning. \n\nSmoke plumes are moving over the region from several forest fires located in the Sandy Lake - Pikangikum region. Winds will become light southwesterly this morning which will direct smoke plumes to the northeast and east. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\nThese smoke plumes will continue to affect the region this morning. For communities north and east of the Sandy Lake - Pikangikum region the plumes will continue through today.\n\nIf you, or someone in your care, develop symptoms, reduce or reschedule strenuous outdoors activities where ever possible until the air quality improves.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-08T23:42:20-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-08T07:43:20-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3753245919.2019<br>Area: Attawapiskat, Sachigo Lake - Bearskin Lake, Big Trout Lake - Kasabonika, Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake, Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell, Summer Beaver - Wunnummin Lake - Kingfisher Lake, Pickle Lake - Cat Lake, Webequie, Fort Hope - Lansdowne House - Ogoki, Red Lake - Woodland Caribou Park, Ear Falls - Perrault Falls - Western Lac Seul, Savant Lake - Sturgeon Lake, Sioux Lookout - Eastern Lac Seul, Kenora - Grassy Narrows - Whitedog, Sioux Narrows - Nestor Falls - Morson, Dryden - Vermilion Bay, Ignace - English River, Fort Frances - Emo - Rainy River, Seine River Village - Mine Centre, Armstrong - Auden - Wabakimi Park, Gull Bay - Black Sturgeon Lake",

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from forest fires over eastern Manitoba and northwestern Ontario continues to linger over eastern portions of the province. \n\nThe air quality is expected to improve today over southeastern Manitoba as the southerly winds continue to push the smoke to the north. Communities closer to the fires and Ontario border, such as Little Grand Rapids and Bissett, may still experience poor air quality through Monday.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nDue to the smoky conditions, individuals living in or travelling to the above noted areas are advised to be aware of potential health concerns that can be associated with current air conditions. In these current conditions, even healthy individuals may experience sore eyes, tears, coughing and a runny nose.\n\nIn areas affected by smoke from wildland fires, Manitobans are encouraged to:\n- limit outdoor activity and/or strenuous physical activity; if breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce the activity\n- reduce exposure to smoke by staying indoors or moving to areas with cleaner air, as conditions can vary dramatically by area\n- turn off furnaces and air-conditioning units that may draw smoke indoors\n- keep indoor air cleaner by avoiding smoking or burning other materials \n\nPeople at higher risk include young children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with heart or lung conditions (particularly asthma), and therefore should avoid as much exposure to smoke as possible.\n\nManitobans with health questions or concerns can contact their health-care provider or call Health Links – Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257. More information on the health effects of smoke is available at www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/smoke.html.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-09T00:34:09-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Manitoba Health, 2019-07-08T10:16:09-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0384990998.2019<br>Area: R.M. of St. Clements incl.
