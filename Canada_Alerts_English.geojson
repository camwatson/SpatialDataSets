				"Summary" : "Description: A long duration snowfall event starting the afternoon of Friday September 27 through Monday September 30 is anticipated for parts of southwestern Alberta as a moisture laden Pacific weather system tracks through the area.\n\nThere is still uncertainty around snowfall accumulations as warm surface temperatures will melt initial snowfall. Current indications suggest that by Monday, total accumulations of 15 to 30 cm over portions of southwestern Alberta are possible. \n\nFor the extreme southwest corner of the province, upslope flow will enhance snowfall along higher terrain with localized snowfall totals of over 50 cm possible by Monday.\n\n\nHeavy snowfall accumulation may cause tree branches to break.\n\nTake frequent breaks and avoid strain when clearing snow.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
