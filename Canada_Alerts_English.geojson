This band will be over the Burlington area early this morning and slowly shift northwards reaching the southwestern section of the City of Toronto by mid morning. Through the afternoon the band will drift south, reaching downtown Hamilton in the evening. Total snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 cm are possible by the time snow tapers off overnight with snowfall rates of several centimeters per hour likely.\n\nUnder the lake effect bands heavy bursts of snow and blowing snow can significantly reduce visibilities.\n\nMotorists are advised to exercise caution and be prepared for quickly changing driving conditions. Consider postponing non essential travel as snow covered and icy roads are expected.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.
