				"Summary" : "Description: A period of very cold wind chills is expected.\n\nAn Arctic high exiting the Prairies will bring another cold night to the region with extreme wind chill values.\n\nTemperatures will dip to -30C or colder tonight across central Saskatchewan and portions of western and southwestern Manitoba. These cold temperatures will combine with winds of 10 to 20 km/h to produce wind chills of -40 to -45.\n\nThese extreme wind chills will moderate on Wednesday morning. Much warmer weather will spread across the Prairies through the second half of the week.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nWatch for cold related symptoms: shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle pain and weakness, numbness and colour change in fingers and toes.\n\nFor more information on cold and your health, visit Manitoba Health at https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/cold.html or call Health Links - Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
