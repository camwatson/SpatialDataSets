Visibility may \nbe suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. There may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas.\n\nDiscussion: Snow heavy at times will affect areas near the west end of Lake Ontario on Tuesday. Easterly flow over the relatively warm waters of Lake Ontario along with the higher terrain of the Niagara Escarpment will both help to locally boost snowfall amounts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The higher snowfall amounts are expected over the escarpment.\n\nWhen: From 7:00 AM EST Tuesday to 7:00 PM EST Tuesday.\n\nImpacts: Rapidly accumulating snow may make travel difficult. Visibility may \nbe suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. There may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas.\n\nDiscussion: Snow heavy at times will affect areas along the Niagara Escarpment. Easterly flow over the relatively warm waters of Lake Ontario along with the higher terrain of the Niagara Escarpment will both help to locally boost snowfall amounts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Winter Weather Travel Advisory in effect for Tuesday morning through to Tuesday evening.\n\nWhat: Total snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 cm snowfall with locally higher amounts near 15 cm possible.  \n\nWhere: City of Toronto. The higher snowfall amounts are most likely over western portions of the city.\n\nWhen: From 8:00 AM EST Tuesday to 9:00 PM EST Tuesday.\n\nImpacts: Rapidly accumulating snow may make travel difficult. Visibility may \nbe suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. There may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic.\n\nDiscussion: Snow heavy at times will affect areas near the west end of Lake Ontario. Easterly flow over the relatively warm waters of Lake Ontario along with higher terrain will help to locally boost snowfall amounts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
