				"Summary" : "Description: Winter Weather Travel Advisory in effect for today and tonight. \n\nWhat: \nSnow. Total amounts of 5 to 15 cm are expected by Friday morning.\n\nWhere: \nPortions of the Greater Toronto Area, particularly downtown Toronto, southern Etobicoke, Mississauga, Milton, and Oakville. \nThis includes sections of the following highways: \n-Highway 403\n-Highway 407\n-Highway 427\n-Queen Elizabeth Way\n-Gardiner Expressway\n\nWhen: \nMidday today through Friday morning. The steadiest snowfall is expected this evening. \n\nDiscussion: \nLake enhanced snowfall is expected to locally boost snowfall amounts to 10 to 15 cm in parts of the west end of the Greater Toronto Area. Accumulating snow could cause poor driving conditions, and impact the commute this evening and Friday morning. The localized nature of lake enhanced snow means that snowfall intensity and accumulations may vary considerably between nearby locations. \n\nActions:\nDrivers should plan to give themselves extra time to reach their destination.\nIf visibility is reduced while driving, slow down, watch for tail lights ahead and be prepared to stop.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: High concentration of pollutants are expected and will result in poor air quality, especially in urban areas where pollutant emissions are higher.\n\nHigh concentrations of pollutants are expected to persist through Thursday morning.\n\n###\n\nSmog especially affects asthmatic children and people with respiratory ailments or heart disease. It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.
