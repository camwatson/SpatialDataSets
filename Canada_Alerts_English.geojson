Snow, ice pellets and potentially freezing rain will eventually taper to flurries by Wednesday afternoon.

An additional 10 to 20 cm is likely. Northeast winds gusting near 50 km/h will result in very poor visibility in blowing snow.\n\nEven higher amounts may be possible in some locations due to extra moisture coming off Lake Ontario. Locally higher amounts may also occur on the higher elevations of the escarpment.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.

Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Where appropriate, maintain physical distancing. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce particulate matter exposure. \n\nReal-time  air  quality  observations  and  information  regarding  the  health  effects  of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-02-16T01:10:55-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Where appropriate, maintain physical distancing. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce particulate matter exposure. \n\nReal-time  air  quality  observations  and  information  regarding  the  health  effects  of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-02-16T01:10:37-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

				"Summary" : "Description: High concentration of pollutants are expected and will result in poor air quality, especially in urban areas where pollutant emissions are higher.\n\nThe high concentrations of pollutants should subside later this morning.\n\n###\n\nSmog especially affects asthmatic children and people with respiratory ailments or heart disease. It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health. You can also visit the Direction régionale de santé publique du CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l’Île-de-Montréal at www.santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-02-15T21:29:58-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux, the Direction régionale de santé publique du CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l’Île-de-Montréal, the City of Montréal, 2021-02-15T13:39:58-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3672411179.2021<br>Area: Louiseville area, Matawin - Mauricie National Park area, Lac-aux-Sables area, Shawinigan area, Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade area, Trois-Rivières area, Portneuf area, Valcartier - Stoneham area, Québec area, Côte-de-Beaupré - L'Île d'Orléans area, Bellechasse area, Lévis area, Saint-Lambert area, Lotbinière area, Bécancour - Villeroy area, Victoriaville area, Nicolet area, Drummondville area, Granby - Waterloo area, Brome-Missisquoi area, Richmond area, Weedon area, Thetford Mines area, Mont-Orford - Lake Memphrémagog area, Sherbrooke area, Coaticook area, Lac-Mégantic area, Cookshire area, Lac-Etchemin area, Sainte-Marie-de-Beauce area, Saint-Georges-de-Beauce area, Montmagny - Saint-Jean-Port-Joli area, Saint-Fabien - Saint-Pamphile area",

				"Summary" : "Description: High concentration of pollutants are expected and will result in poor air quality, especially in urban areas where pollutant emissions are higher.\n\nHigh concentrations of pollutants are expected to diminish this morning.\n\n###\n\nSmog especially affects asthmatic children and people with respiratory ailments or heart disease. It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.
