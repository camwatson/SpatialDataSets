				"Summary" : "Description: Winter Weather Travel Advisory in effect for this morning and afternoon. \n\nA strengthening low pressure system is expected to bring a wintry mix of weather to the area beginning this morning. Precipitation will likely begin as ice pellets with a risk of freezing rain before transitioning to snow late in the morning or early afternoon. The snow is then expected to taper off later in the afternoon to freezing drizzle or flurries. \n\nSome areas may see snow and ice pellet accumulations of 5 to 10 cm.  Some additional snowfall is possible later tonight with a few centimetres likely.\n\nStrong wind gusts up to 70 km/h and local blowing snow reducing visibilities are also possible.\n\nTravel on roads will likely become hazardous.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Ice build-up may cause tree branches to break.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
