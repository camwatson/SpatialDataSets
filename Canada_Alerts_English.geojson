				"Summary" : "Description: Tropical storm force winds ahead of Hurricane Teddy are expected over the regions, but will remain just below wind warning criteria.\n\nPotential wind gusts: 65 to 80 km/h over exposed areas and along parts of the coast. \n\nLocations: The Annapolis Valley, northern Nova Scotia, and western Cape Breton.\n\nTime span: tonight, with a second period of strong winds likely on Wednesday.\n\nRemarks: Strong northeasterly winds will persist tonight ahead of Hurricane Teddy.  Winds are expected to remain below wind warning criteria, but could still gust up to 80 km/h over exposed areas and along parts of the coast. A second round of strong northwesterly winds are expected on Wednesday in the wake of Post-Tropical Storm Teddy after it crosses eastern Nova Scotia in the morning. These northwesterly winds could potentially gust to 70 to 80 km/h as well before diminishing late in the day.\n\n###\n\nA tropical storm watch means that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds near 65 km/h or more) are possible over parts of the region within 36 hours.\n\nBy nature, a tropical storm also implies the threat of local flooding from heavy rainfall - consult your local area forecast for possible rainfall warnings.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. Reports of storm conditions and impacts can be emailed directly to NSstorm@canada.ca or by tweeting reports by province using #NSStorm, #NBStorm, #PEStorm, #NLwx, #QCStorm or #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-09-24T00:11:00-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-09-22T18:12:00-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3886852421.2020<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Pictou County, Antigonish County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north",

They will bring periods of heavy rain and strong winds in the first active storm cycle of the the fall season.\n\nThe first system arrives on Vancouver Island tonight, and will spread to the mainland before Wednesday morning and continue through Thursday.\n\nRainfall intensity will vary through the day and across regions. Over Vancouver Island, total rainfall amounts over the two day period will generally range from 15 to 40 mm, with amounts excess of 100 mm over West Vancouver Island.\n\nFor the mainland coast, total rainfall amounts will range from 50 mm to in excess of 100 mm over the two day period. The heaviest rainfall amounts are currently expected over Howe Sound and the North Shore.\n\nThis system will also bring strong southeast winds to the west coast of Vancouver Island Tuesday night, with winds of 60 to 80 km/h. As the system progresses, winds across the Strait of Georgia and surrounding regions will peak early Wednesday morning at 50 to 70 km/h. \n\nThe combination of heavy rain with leaves on the ground may lead to localized flooding. Strong winds may also lead to power outages.\n\nThe wet pattern will continue with more rain expected Friday and Saturday.\n\nRainfall and wind warnings may be issued as the system approaches.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Winds are expected to remain below wind warning criteria, but could still gust up to 80 km/h over exposed areas and along parts of the coast. A second round of strong northwesterly winds are expected on Wednesday in the wake of Post-Tropical Storm Teddy after it crosses eastern Nova Scotia in the morning. These northwesterly winds could potentially gust to 70 to 80 km/h as well before diminishing late in the day.\n\n###\n\nA tropical storm watch means that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds near 65 km/h or more) are possible over parts of the region within 36 hours.\n\nBy nature, a tropical storm also implies the threat of local flooding from heavy rainfall - consult your local area forecast for possible rainfall warnings.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

For the Eastern Shore and Cape Breton, near the high tides this evening and near noon Wednesday. \n\nRemarks: Storm surge and very large breaking waves are the main concern and could pose a significant threat. Currently 4-6 metre waves at the coast will build to 7-9 metres early this evening with waves breaking higher along parts of the coast. The high waves will persist into the overnight period. Early Wednesday as Teddy approaches, eastern Nova Scotia will see very large wave and significant storm surge. Outside of the times for high tide, there is still a threat for very large waves, rough and pounding surf, and local overwash. The public should exercise extreme caution.\n\n###\n\nThis is a potentially dangerous situation. High waves combined with the surge may cause damage along the coast. Coastal flooding is possible along the shoreline.\n\nStorm surge warnings are issued when water levels pose a threat to coastal regions.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Winds are expected to gust to 80 to 100 km/h over exposed areas and along parts of the coast this evening.
