The highest accumulation will be over the North Shore and the northeast sector of Metro Vancouver. The higher elevations of West and North Vancouver, Coquitlam, Port Moody, Surrey and Maple Ridge will get 15 to 25 cm accumulation by late morning. \n\nThe City of Vancouver and Burnaby will receive 10 to 15 cm total. \n\nAt low elevations and near the Strait of Georgia (for example, Richmond) accumulations will likely be up to 5 cm.\n\nThe Fraser Valley will see 5 to 15 cm total accumulation by early afternoon. The higher end of the range will occur north of the Fraser River.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. There may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Temperatures are expected to drop to below the freezing mark on Saturday, changing the rain into freezing rain. Several hours of freezing rain may occur until temperatures climb to above freezing again on Sunday. This scenario is expected to result in significant ice accretion over these regions. \n\nStrong southwest winds gusting to 70 km/h are also expected Sunday morning, with the highest gusts occurring along the shores of Lake Huron. Strong winds coupled with ice build-up on tree branches and power lines could cause power outages in the hardest hit areas.\n\nRainfall amounts may reach up to 25 mm, although there remains considerable uncertainty at this time. Freezing rain warnings will be issued as the event draws nearer.\n\nTravel will be impacted throughout Southern Ontario Saturday into Sunday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Freezing rain, rain and strong winds Saturday into Sunday.  \n\nLight rain or drizzle is expected to develop this afternoon and become heavy early Saturday morning. Temperatures are expected to drop to below the freezing mark on Saturday, changing the rain into freezing rain. Several hours of freezing rain may occur until temperatures climb to above freezing again on Sunday. This scenario is expected to result in significant ice accretion over these regions.  \n\nStrong southwest winds gusting to 70 km/h are also possible Sunday morning. Strong winds coupled with ice build-up on tree branches and power lines could cause power outages in the hardest hit areas.  \n\nRainfall amounts may reach up to 25 mm, although there remains considerable uncertainty at this time. Warnings will be issued as the event draws nearer.  \n\nTravel will be impacted throughout Southern Ontario Saturday into Sunday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
