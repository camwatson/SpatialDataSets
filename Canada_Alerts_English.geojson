				"Summary" : "Description: 5 to 20 cm of snow by this afternoon.\n\nThe low pressure system continues its trek across the south coast this morning. In the wake of the low this afternoon, northeast outflow winds will collide with northwest winds from the Strait of Georgia. Where they meet, a localised band of heavy snow will develop and push through Metro Vancouver this evening for further localised accumulations of 5 cm.\n\nHigher elevations of West Vancouver, North Vancouver and Coquitlam will continue to see snow today with a further 5 to 10 cm.\n\nVancouver, Burnaby and New Westminster will see wet snow mixed with rain. Precipitation type will depend on proximity to the water, elevation, precipitation intensity and wind direction. A further 5 cm is forecast for these cities.\n\nInland sections of Metro Vancouver - SE such as north Surrey and Langley will continue to see snow today with local accumulations of 2 to 4 cm. Southern sections will see rain, at times mixed with snow, as southerly winds keep temperatures above zero.\n\nRichmond, Delta, Tsawwassen and Ladner will continue to see rain today as the southerly winds have been keeping temperatures above freezing.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A multi-day episode of very cold wind chills continues.\n\nWind chill values of minus 40 or colder will continue through the coming week and into next weekend. Some brief improvement may occur during the afternoon hours.\n\nAs an Arctic airmass descends southward across Alberta this weekend, this extreme cold warning will continue to be expanded.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nWatch for cold related symptoms: shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle pain and weakness, numbness and colour change in fingers and toes.\n\nExtreme cold warnings are issued when very cold temperatures or wind chill creates an elevated risk to health such as frost bite and hypothermia.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
