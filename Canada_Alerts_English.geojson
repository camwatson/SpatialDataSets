As the front approaches, northeasterly winds will develop through the mainland inlets, causing temperatures to drop to near, or below freezing for the Sea to Sky Highway and Whistler regions.\n\nLight snow will start near midnight tonight and persist through Monday giving accumulations of 5 to 10 cm. However, later Monday the snowfall rate will pick up significantly and a further 15 cm could fall before snow changes to rain on Tuesday.\n\nTotal snowfall accumulations of 20 to 25 cm are expected.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

After the system passes overnight, increasing northwest winds will result in the development of lake effect flurries and snow squalls which will persist into Monday.\n\nSnowfall accumulations of 15 to 20 cm will be possible in some areas from tonight until late Monday. In addition, northwest winds gusting to 70 km/h will result in areas of blowing snow giving very poor visibility.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
