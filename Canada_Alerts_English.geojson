Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Significant Snow on Tuesday. \n\nA favourable set up for widespread low elevation snow over the south coast is shaping up for Tuesday and Tuesday night. A front will track down the BC coast beginning Tuesday morning and combine with a cool airmass to produce snow across the lowlands.\n\nSnowfall amounts will vary significantly across the region. The air will be cool, but not truly Arctic, so snowfall amounts will vary with proximity to the water, elevation and intensity of precipitation. \n\nAnywhere from 5 to 20 cm of heavy, wet snow is expected. The highest amounts are likely over Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley where the snow will persist the longest, until Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. Warmer air will arrive faster over Vancouver Island and the transition to rain there will start Tuesday afternoon. \n\nPrecipitation should be rain everywhere across the south coast lowlands by  Wednesday as a flow of milder Pacific air returns.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total amounts of 10 to 20 cm is expected.\n\nSignificant Snow on Tuesday.\n \nA favourable set up for widespread low elevation snow over the south coast is shaping up for Tuesday and Tuesday night. A front will track down the BC coast beginning Tuesday morning and combine with a cool airmass to produce snow across the lowlands.  \n\nSnowfall amounts will vary significantly across the region. The air will be cool, but not truly Arctic, so snowfall amounts will vary with proximity to the water, elevation and intensity of precipitation. \n\nAnywhere from 5 to 20 cm of heavy, wet snow is expected. The highest amounts are expected over the northern and inland sections of Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley where the snow will persist the longest, until Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. Warmer air will arrive faster over Sunshine Coast and the southwestern sections of Metro Vancouver and the transition to rain there will start Tuesday afternoon or evening. \n\nPrecipitation should be rain everywhere across the south coast lowlands by Wednesday as a flow of milder Pacific air returns.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. There may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
