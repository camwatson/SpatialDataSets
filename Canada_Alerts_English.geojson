After this period of rain, snow will redevelop Saturday night before easing Sunday morning. \n\nAt this point in time, forecast guidance suggests near 10 cm of new snowfall can be expected by the time the snow comes to an end. However for areas near and south of Peawanuck, snowfall accumulations near 15 cm are possible and a Snowfall warning may be required.\n\nAlso, very strong northerly winds gusting up to 70 km/h are forecast to develop Saturday night resulting in reduced visibilities in blowing snow at times.\n\nThis heavy snow is associated with a strengthening low pressure system that will track across northern Ontario Saturday and Saturday night.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
