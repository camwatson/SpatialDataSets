				"Summary" : "Description: A long period of snowfall with total amounts of 15 to 20 cm is expected.\n\nSnow and blowing snow in store for Monday.\n\nA Pacific low pressure system will develop in the Gulf of Alaska tonight and then cross the Alaska Panhandle on Monday. It will track east along the 60th parallel to pass just south of Whitehorse late Monday afternoon and close to Watson Lake by late Monday evening. Snow is forecast to develop tonight and persist all day Monday. Total snowfall amounts of 15 to 20 cm are likely through Monday night. In addition, south winds will develop Monday morning and then shift to strong northwest winds Monday evening. This will cause local blowing snow and poor visibilities.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
