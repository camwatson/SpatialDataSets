Some areas could see gusts approach 100 km/h on Wednesday as winds shift to northwesterly.\n\nRemarks: A deep low pressure system will track near the Avalon Peninsula.  While it seems likely that precipitation will be mainly rain, the snow-rain line is expected to be near the isthmus.  If the track of the low were to shift further southeast, significant snowfall could be possible over the western Avalon.  Rainfall warnings are unlikely at this point, since the ground is not frozen and there is no snowpack.

				"Summary" : "Description: Significant Snowfall for Tuesday night and Wednesday.\n\nLocations: Eastern half of the Island, excluding the Avalon and Burin peninsulas.\n\nPossible snowfall: Generally 10 to 20 cm with potential for higher amounts locally.\n\nWinds: Generally northeasterly 40 gusting to 60 km/h with stronger coastal gusts.  Some areas along the south and east coasts could see gusts approach 100 km/h.\n\nRemarks: The cause of this disruption to our lack of winter weather will be a deep low pressure system passing near the Avalon Peninsula.  Snow will begin on Tuesday evening and persist in some areas until Wednesday afternoon. Temperatures are expected to be near zero, which means areas along the coast may see the snow mix with or change completely over to rain.  Unfortunately, this also means the snow is likely going to be rather wet and heavy.  We will also likely see a period of freezing rain and ice pellets over the easternmost regions Tuesday night into Wednesday morning.\n\nExtra considerations for the Clarenville area and the Bonavista Peninsula:  These areas are expected to be right along the snow-rain line.  If the storm track shifts further northwest, precipitation in these areas could easily be mostly rain, with up to 30 mm possible instead of snow.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
