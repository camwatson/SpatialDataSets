Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nA cold airmass combined with winds off the waters of Lake Winnipeg will create a favourable setup for snowsqualls.  \n\nOver the next few hours the winds are expected to shift to the northwest, bringing snow squalls to the eastern shores of Lake Winnipeg.\n\nSnow amounts will be highly localized but may exceed 20 to 30 cm in some areas by the time the snow squalls diminish on Saturday night.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Rapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
