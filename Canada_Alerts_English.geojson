				"Summary" : "Description: Rain followed by possibly heavy snow tonight.\n\nA system moving through southern Saskatchewan is bringing rain and wet snow to southeastern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba.  As this system progresses southward the rain will transition over completely to snow tonight. \n\nThere is currently a good deal of uncertainty on how fast this transition to snow will occur and with convective elements in the precipitation, there is also uncertainty on total snowfall accumulation. The exact track of the low, the initial melting on warm ground and the capacity of snow to accumulate on higher terrain will all play a role in determining how much snow will accumulate. At this moment, we expect a swath of snow between 5 to 10 cm to fall from Yorkton south to Oxbow and east through Brandon and Pilot Mound. However, because of the uncertainty we cannot rule out locally higher amounts that exceed 10 cm of snow, especially along higher terrain. \nSnowfall is expected to completely exit the area early Saturday morning.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Rain followed by possibly heavy snow tonight.\n\nA system moving through southern Saskatchewan is bringing rain and wet snow to southeastern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba.  As this system progresses southward the rain will transition over completely to snow tonight. \n\nThere is currently a good deal of uncertainty on how fast this transition to snow will occur and with convective elements in the precipitation, there is also uncertainty on total snowfall accumulation. The exact track of the low, the initial melting on warm ground and the capacity of snow to accumulate on higher terrain will all play a role in determining how much snow will accumulate. At this moment, we expect a swath of snow between 5 to 10 cm to fall from Yorkton south to Oxbow and east through Brandon and Pilot Mound. However, because of the uncertainty we cannot rule out locally higher amounts that exceed 10 cm of snow, especially along higher terrain. \nSnowfall is expected to completely exit the area early Saturday morning.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

These conditions are forecast to spread eastward across northern Nova Scotia later tonight, reaching the Cape Breton Highlands during the overnight hours. Conditions will improve Sunday morning over western areas of the province, and later in the morning or in the afternoon over eastern regions.\n\nLarge waves, pounding surf and elevated sea levels are expected. \n\nLocations: the Nova Scotia coastline of the Bay of Fundy, including the Minas Basin.\n\nTime Span: from 11:00 p.m. this evening to 3:00 am on Sunday.\n\nRemarks: An intensifying low pressure system will pass just north of Nova Scotia today. This will give storm surge combined with waves approaching the Fundy coast of the province from the west, as well as large spring tides this weekend. The combined effects may cause minor flooding. If the storm track or intensity changes, storm surge warnings may be required.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
