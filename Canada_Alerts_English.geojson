				"Summary" : "Description: Brief but intense snowfall with blowing snow expected Thursday morning.\n\nTotal snowfall: 5 to 10 cm, with locally higher amounts possible.\n\nWind gusts: up to 70 km/h\n\nLocations: Cape Breton and Eastern Nova Scotia.\n\nTime span: 3 A.M. to 9 A.M. Thursday morning.\n\nRemarks: A short period of heavy snow accompanied by strong northerly winds and blowing snow is forecast to move over eastern Nova Scotia early Thursday morning. Snowfall rates approaching 2 to 5 cm per hour and blowing snow will combine to give poor visibilities at times. Conditions will improve quickly as the snow tapers off later Thursday morning.  \n\nAt present, it is expected that the Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County region will avoid the heavier snow, strong winds, and blowing snow, but this could change if the track of the system responsible shifts further to the east.\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
