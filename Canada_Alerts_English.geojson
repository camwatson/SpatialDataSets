Below seasonal temperatures to continue through the weekend.\n\nA low pressure system off Vancouver Island will move into Washington State this evening. Meanwhile, modified Arctic air will advance southward through the B.C. interior. The Arctic front is expected to move across the southern interior tonight.\n\nWith a somewhat cool airmass already in place, widespread snow is expected from Bella Coola and Whistler eastward to 100 Mile and the southwest interior, and further to the Kootenays and parts of the Columbias. Snow may become mixed with rain over southern and eastern portions of this area. Currently, forecast snowfall amounts range from 5 to 20 cm.\n\nIn the wake of the low, a drying trend begins on Saturday as the Arctic air spreads through the rest of the southern interior. Temperatures of 10 degrees below seasonal normals are expected through the weekend.\n\nBe prepared to adjust your driving with changing road conditions.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: More early season snowfall expected today as Arctic air arrives. Below seasonal temperatures to continue through the weekend.\n\nA low pressure system off Vancouver Island will move into Washington State this evening. Meanwhile, modified Arctic air will advance southward through the B.C. interior. The Arctic front is expected to move across the southern interior tonight.\n\nWith a somewhat cool airmass already in place, widespread snow is expected from Bella Coola and Whistler eastward to 100 Mile and the southwest interior, and further to the Kootenays and parts of the Columbias. Snow may become mixed with rain over southern and eastern portions of this area. Currently, forecast snowfall amounts range from 5 to 20 cm.\n\nIn the wake of the low, a drying trend begins on Saturday as the Arctic air spreads through the rest of the southern interior. Temperatures of 10 degrees below seasonal normals are expected through the weekend.\n\nBe prepared to adjust your driving with changing road conditions.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-10-24T11:57:44-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-10-23T19:58:44-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3023840255.2020<br>Area: Highway 3 - Paulson Summit to Kootenay Pass, Highway 97 - Clinton to 100 Mile House via Begbie Summit, Trans-Canada Highway - Eagle Pass to Rogers Pass, Sea to Sky - Squamish to Whistler",

				"Summary" : "Description: Early season wet snow over higher terrain is possible early this afternoon as a modified Arctic airmass arrives on the coast. Below seasonal temperatures will continue through the weekend.\n\nA low pressure system off Vancouver Island will move into Washington State this evening. Meanwhile, Arctic air will advance southward through the B.C. interior. The onset of precipitation combined with falling temperatures will bring a risk of wet snow to neighbourhoods and roadways above 300 m. \n\nThe system will move out of the region this evening but a cold airmass settling in behind will ensure temperatures remain 5 to 8 degrees below seasonal normals through the weekend.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nA cold air mass and northwesterly winds are creating snowsqualls along the eastern shores of Lake Winnipeg. \n\nThe snow squalls will persist in the area this evening but are expected to move off shore, back over Lake Winnipeg, as winds shift to the north overnight. Flurries will continue in the region on Saturday but for the most part the heavier snowsqualls will remain over Lake Winnipeg through to Sunday morning. There is a possibility snowsqualls could shift eastward back over the warning area on Sunday as winds gradually come back around to the northwest.\n\nTotal snow amounts will be highly localized but may exceed 20 to 30 cm in some areas by the end of the weekend.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Rapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
