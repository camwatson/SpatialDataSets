				"Summary" : "Description: Significant winter storm expected Friday into Saturday.\n\nLocations: northeastern Newfoundland and the Burin Peninsula.\n\nTotal snowfall: 15 to 30 cm with locally higher amounts possible.\n\nMaximum wind gusts: northerly 90 to 110 km/h inland, with gusts to 120 to 130 km/h along exposed areas of the coast.\n\nStorm surge: Higher than normal water levels along the east and northeast coasts due to 60 to 80 cm of storm surge combined with 7 to 10 m waves. Flooding and damage to coastal infrastructure is possible, especially in communities exposed to the north. Highest water levels are expected near high tide Friday night and early Saturday afternoon. \n\nTime span: Friday morning until Saturday morning.\n\nRemarks: An intense storm will affect the island through the day Friday into Saturday. Anyone planning travel or other weather-sensitive activities is urged to monitor forecasts and to consider alternate plans. Visibility is expected to be reduced to near zero over some areas, with blizzard conditions possible. \n\nConditions are expected to improve early on Saturday for some areas but strong winds, snow and blowing snow will persist over coastal areas in the northeast until midday.\n\n###\n\nWinter storm watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Stagnant winter weather conditions are creating elevated pollution levels.\n\n(January 15, 2020, 9 am): The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Northern Health has issued an Air Quality Advisory for Prince George and Vanderhoof due to high concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5)\n\nThe City of Prince George's Clean Air Bylaw prohibits all open burning, including backyard burning, and land clearing burning. During air quality advisories, this bylaw also prohibits recreational fires, use of wood-burning appliances (except for sole wood burning heat users), and street sweeping activities (unless approved by an Authorized Person). Industry is required to follow permit requirements that are triggered during air quality advisories and are asked to reduce emissions wherever possible.\n\n###\n\nPeople with cardiovascular disease can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate the disease leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-01-16T09:11:38-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
