Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nExposure is particularly a concern for individuals with chronic conditions such as\nasthma, COPD, heart disease, and diabetes; respiratory infections such as COVID-19; pregnant women, infants, and older adults. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Where appropriate, maintain physical distancing. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider.\n\nStaying indoors helps to reduce particulate matter exposure.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of\nair pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-\nwater/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-03-05T16:02:30-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

				"Summary" : "Description: Near zero visibility in fog is expected or occurring over some areas.\n\nThe combination of clear skies, light winds and melting snow create ideal conditions for fog development. \n\nAs a result, widespread reduced visibilities continue to be reported over a number of locations in the southern prairies this morning. Most regions will see visibilities improve later this morning. However, some may see the fog linger into the early afternoon. \n\nWidespread fog is not expected again Friday night due to strengthening southerly winds across the eastern prairies.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Near zero visibility in fog is expected or occurring over some areas.\n\nThe combination of clear skies, light winds and melting snow create ideal conditions for fog development. \n\nAs a result, widespread reduced visibilities continue to be reported over a number of locations in the southern prairies this morning. Most regions will see visibilities improve later this morning. However, some may see the fog linger into the early afternoon. \n\nWidespread fog is not expected again Friday night due to strengthening southerly winds across the eastern prairies.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
