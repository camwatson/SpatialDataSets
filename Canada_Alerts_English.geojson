A SPECIAL AIR QUALITY STATEMENT is in place due to the possibility of deteriorating air quality. Hot and sunny conditions are expected to cause increasing ground-level ozone concentrations this afternoon , in the above regions. Moderate risk AQHI values are expected throughout the day with the potential of short-term high risk AQHI values in the afternoon.\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk. If you, or someone in your care, develop symptoms, reduce or reschedule strenuous outdoors activities where ever possible until the air quality improves.\n\n###\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-06-21T12:25:55-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2020-06-20T20:26:55-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1264632662.2020<br>Area: Watford - Pinery Park - Eastern Lambton County, Sarnia - Petrolia - Western Lambton County, Windsor - Leamington - Essex County, City of Toronto, Newmarket - Georgina - Northern York Region, Pickering - Oshawa - Southern Durham Region, Vaughan - Richmond Hill - Markham, Mississauga - Brampton",
