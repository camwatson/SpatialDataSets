Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2020-07-17T21:29:56-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-17T18:49:56-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3636700996.2020<br>Area: Mun. of Glenboro-South Cypress incl.
