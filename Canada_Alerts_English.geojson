Frost is possible across much of the region tonight, although will be most likely in the southern Interlake into southeastern Manitoba.\n\nIn the Red River Valley, temperatures will remain warmest near the western escarpment where lows will likely fall to the 0 to +1C range. Towards the Red River, frost becomes more likely, then becomes probable east of the Red River. In Winnipeg, frost is likely in open and outlying regions, however areas closer to the core will likely remain above freezing.\n\nEven in areas that will generally remain above freezing across southern Manitoba, isolated patches of frost will be possible in low-lying areas or areas cold air drainage.\n\nTemperatures will recover early Saturday morning, followed by a general warming trend over the coming days.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nStrong thunderstorms will develop over Fraser Canyon north, South Thompson, Nicola and Similkameen this afternoon. Heavy downpours and strong wind gusts are possible with these thunderstorms. \n\nStrong thunderstorms will develop over Okanagan, Shuswap, Boundary region, West Kootenay and Arrow Slocan this evening with possible heavy downpours, very strong wind gusts and large hail.\n\n###\n\nFast-moving water across a road can sweep a vehicle away. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Heavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
