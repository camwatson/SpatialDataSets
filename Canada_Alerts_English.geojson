The exact accumulation will vary depending on the intensity of any one of those pockets of showers and the duration. Generally, no more than 4 cm is expected.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A period of hot, humid weather ahead for southern Manitoba.\n\nTemperatures will soar for Tuesday and Wednesday across southern Manitoba. A warm front pushing into the region will bring a hot, humid air mass into the province. Temperatures will climb above 30°C both days, and humidex values will reach the mid- to upper-30s as the humidity increases.\n\nOn Tuesday night, a breezy southerly wind combined with the hot and humid air mass will keep temperatures very warm through the night. In the Red River Valley, temperatures will likely only drop to around 23 or 24°C, while areas in southeastern Manitoba will see temperatures dip a couple degrees cooler.\n\nA cold front will move through the province on Wednesday night, bringing a return to more seasonal temperatures and humidity.\n\nIn addition to the heat, much of southern Manitoba will see the potential for thunderstorm activity over the coming days. Some of these thunderstorms will likely be severe with a variety of threats. The humid conditions will support very heavy rainfall with some thunderstorms that develop. Areas in southeastern Manitoba affected by recent heavy rains may see more torrential rainfall; on Wednesday, the region could see narrow bands of training thunderstorms resulting in significant rainfall accumulation.\n\nPlease refer to the daily local forecasts and ECCC's Thunderstorm Outlook product (disseminated on ECCC's weather-related social media accounts) for further details.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-06-16T12:29:18-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-15T20:30:18-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3056660605.2020<br>Area: City of Winnipeg, R.M. of Coldwell incl.
