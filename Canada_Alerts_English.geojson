Significant ice accretion of 10 to 20 mm is possible Saturday night from the freezing rain.\n\nBrisk northerly winds Sunday are also possible. These winds coupled with ice build up on tree branches and power lines could cause a few power outages. \nWarnings will be issued as the event draws nearer.  \n\nTravel will be impacted throughout Southern Ontario Saturday into Sunday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Rainfall, combined with melting snow, is expected. The frozen ground has a reduced ability to absorb this rainfall.\n\nA soaker on tap Saturday. \n\nA moisture laden low from Texas will spread rain across Eastern Ontario overnight into Saturday, with most areas receiving a total of 20 to 30 mm by Saturday evening. The rain is then expected to change over to freezing rain Saturday evening as temperatures slide down to the zero degree mark.\n\nSince the ground is frozen, the winter rainfall warning criterion of 25 mm in 24 hours is being met.  \n\nFor information concerning flooding, please consult your local conservation authority or Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry district office.\n\nFreezing rain may last for several hours Saturday night before becoming mixed with ice pellets or a couple cm of snow Sunday. Significant ice accretion of 10 to 20 mm is possible Saturday night from the freezing rain. Freezing rain warnings will likely be issued as this event draws closer. \n\nBrisk northerly winds Sunday are also possible. These winds coupled with ice build up on tree branches and power lines could cause a few power outages. \nWarnings will be issued as the event draws nearer.  \n\nTravel will be impacted throughout Southern Ontario Saturday into Sunday.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Rainfall, combined with melting snow, is expected. The frozen ground has a reduced ability to absorb this rainfall.\n\nA soaker on tap. \n\nA moisture laden low from Texas will bring a significant heavy rainfall event to Southern Ontario Saturday. \n\nRain is expected to become continuous and heavy at times overnight then continue Saturday. Total rainfall amounts of 40 to 60 mm are anticipated by Saturday evening.\n\nSince the ground is frozen, the winter rainfall warning criterion of 25 mm in 24 hours is being met.  \n\nThe rain may change over to freezing rain beginning Saturday evening as temperatures dip to near the zero degree mark. Freezing rain warnings may be needed as this event draws closer.\n\nStrong westerly winds gusting to 60 km/h Sunday morning coupled with possible ice build-up on tree branches and power lines may result in local power outages. \n\nFor information concerning flooding, please consult your local conservation authority or Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry district office.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
