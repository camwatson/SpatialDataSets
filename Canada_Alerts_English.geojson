Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nExposure is particularly a concern for individuals with chronic conditions such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, and diabetes, respiratory infections such as COVID-19, pregnant women, infants, and older adults. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Where appropriate, maintain physical distancing. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider.\n\nStaying indoors helps to reduce particulate matter exposure.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-03-18T07:06:53-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

Strong southerly winds will accompany the rain, combining with temperatures well above freezing to cause considerable snow melt.  If possible, storm drains should be cleared before Thursday night, as a combination of rain, snow melt, and runoff will likely lead to minor flooding in areas where pooling water cannot drain properly.\n\nRain will change to snow Friday evening with a period of freezing rain or ice pellets possible during the transition.  Note that as temperatures fall below freezing Friday night, conditions will likely become quite icy.

This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nExposure is a concern for pregnant women, infants, and older adults, as well as, individuals with conditions such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, diabetes or respiratory infections such as COVID-19. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Where appropriate, maintain physical distancing. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-03-17T22:19:33-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

Strong southerly winds will accompany the rain, combining with temperatures well above freezing to cause considerable snow melt.  If possible, storm drains should be cleared before Thursday night, as a combination of rain, snow melt, and runoff will likely lead to minor flooding in areas where pooling water cannot drain properly.\n\nRain will change to potentially significant snow Friday evening with a period of freezing rain or ice pellets possible during the transition.  Note that as temperatures fall below freezing Friday night, conditions will likely become quite icy.
