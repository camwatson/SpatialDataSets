They will bring periods of heavy rain and strong winds in the first active storm cycle of the the fall season.\n\nThe first system will spread rain to Vancouver Island and the mainland today and Thursday. \n\nRainfall intensity will vary through the day and across regions. Over Vancouver Island, total rainfall amounts over the two day period will generally range from 15 to 40 mm, with amounts in excess of 100 mm over West Vancouver Island. For the mainland coast, total rainfall amounts will range from 30 mm to over 50 mm for the two day period. The heaviest rainfall amounts are currently expected near the mountains.\n\nThis system will also bring strong southeast winds to the west coast of Vancouver Island early this morning. Strong winds over the Strait of Georgia and surrounding regions will peak early this morning. Winds will diminish later today, but gusty conditions will continue.\n\nTonight and Thursday, unsettled conditions will bring a risk of thunderstorms across the region as well.\n\nThe combination of heavy rain with leaves on the ground may lead to localized flooding. Strong winds may also lead to power outages.\n\nThe wet pattern will continue with more rain expected Friday and Saturday.\n\nRainfall and wind warnings are now in effect for some regions, and will be updated as needed.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Today's heavy rainfall is the first storm in a week-long series that brings a major pattern change to the province of BC, in particular the south coast. Periods of rain, heavy at times, will continue through Saturday. Embedded thunderstorms and gusty winds are possible.\n\nThis sudden change to a prolonged wet pattern combined with local gusty winds and trees shedding their leaves may lead to localized flooding. Strong winds may also lead to power outages.\n\nLate this week the pattern is intensified once again by a strong low pressure system crossing Vancouver Island Thursday night or Friday. Strong winds, and where they materialize, will depend on the exact storm track. Stay tuned to your local forecast throughout the week as we follow the evolution of this feature.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
