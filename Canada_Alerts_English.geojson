Snow will begin along the south coast on Wednesday afternoon and spread elsewhere by evening.  Some areas in northeastern Newfoundland may see a brief change over to rain or drizzle overnight on Wednesday night before changing back to snow again on Thursday.  Strong winds will combine with falling snow to reduce visibility in blowing snow, especially in the  northeast on Thursday.  Conditions will improve in the south and central by mid day on Thursday, but will continue in the west and northeast until Thursday evening.\n\nAt this time, the Great Northern Peninsula may receive the least amount of snow, with potentially less snow than mentioned above.
