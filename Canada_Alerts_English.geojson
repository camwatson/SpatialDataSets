				"Summary" : "Description: For Post-tropical Storm Dorian.\n\nThe next intermediate statement will be issued at 12:00 a.m. ADT.\nFollowed by the full information statement issued at 03:00 a.m. ADT.\n\nThe center of Post-Tropical cyclone Dorian made landfall just southwest of Halifax earlier this evening. Dorian will continue to track across the Maritimes with destructive winds and heavy rainfall this evening.\n\n1. Summary of basic information at 09:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: Near 45.0 North 63.2 West.\n\nAbout: 48 kilometres north-northeast of Halifax.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 148 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: northeast at 47 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 958 millibars.\n\n\n2. Public weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nDorian made landfall over the Chebucto Peninsula of Nova Scotia (southwest of Halifax) between Terence Bay and Sambro at approximately 7:15 pm this evening. The center of the storm will continue tracking northeastward tonight, passing near eastern Prince Edward Island around midnight, and then over the eastern Gulf of St. Lawrence waters or western Newfoundland by Sunday morning. \n\nSevere winds and torrential rain will continue to impact parts of Nova Scotia, southeastern New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Western Newfoundland, the Magdalen Islands and the Quebec's Lower North Shore tonight. Large waves are expected for the Atlantic coasts of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and for eastern portions of the Gulf of St. Lawrence tonight. Finally, storm surge, combined with large waves and pounding surf, may give flooding for parts of eastern Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, the Magdalen Islands, and parts of the Quebec's Lower North Shore.\n\nHurricane warnings are in effect for the south shore, central and eastern Nova Scotia and western Newfoundland. Hurricane Watches are in effect for eastern Prince Edward Island, and the Magdalen Islands. \n\nTropical storm warnings are in effect for southeastern New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, western and northern Nova Scotia, parts of northern and southwestern Newfoundland, the Magdalen Islands and parts of Quebec's Lower North Shore. \n\n\na.

Damaging east to northeasterly winds will continue ahead of Dorian's track tonight, with severe and damaging northwesterly winds developing in its wake. Wind impacts will likely be enhanced by foliage on the trees, causing broken branches and tree falls, widespread power outages, blocking of roads, and other type of damages. \n\nb. Rainfall.\n\nSeveral reporting stations in western Nova Scotia and southeastern New Brunswick have already received in excess of 100 mm of as of early this evening. \n\nRainfall warnings have been ended for the southwestern corner of Nova Scotia, from Yarmouth to Halifax. Rainfall warning remain in effect for the remainder of Nova Scotia, western Prince Edward Island, most of New Brunswick stretching from the southwest towards the Gaspesie, and parts of the Lower North Shore Quebec. \n\nWidespread rainfall amounts of 50 to 100 mm are expected over Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and the Magdalen Islands. Maximum amounts are likely over western Nova Scotia where 100 to 200 mm are possible. These amounts and rainfall rates could easily give rise to road washouts and localized flash flooding.\n\nc. Surge/Waves.\n\nStorm surge warnings have been ended for southwestern Nova Scotia including Halifax, but remain in effect for most of the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, the north shore of Prince Edward Island, western Cape Breton, portions of southwestern Newfoundland, the Magdalen Islands, Quebec's Lower Quebec North Shore, and Anticosti Island.\n\nFor eastern Nova Scotia high waves and storm surge may cause flooding for some low lying coastal areas tonight.\n\nFor the southwestern Newfoundland and areas along the Gulf of Saint Lawrence localized flooding due to storm surge and high waves are likely during high tide tonight.\n\nThere will also be rough and pounding surf, especially for parts of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence tonight. Waves of 7 to 10 metres are reaching the southwestern shore of Nova Scotia this evening and will reach Eastern Shore tonight. These waves will likely reach southern Newfoundland by Sunday morning with waves nearing 12 metres. Waves of 4 to 7 metres will impact north facing coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Note that waves will break higher along some of the coastlines, and dangerous rip currents are likely. Please exercise extreme caution. \n\n\n3. Marine weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nHurricane force wind warnings are in effect for most Atlantic waters, storm warnings are in effect for other waters in the Maritimes. For Newfoundland, hurricane force wind warnings are in effect for eastern Gulf of St. Lawrence waters, storm force warnings for the southwest and northeast coasts, and the strait of Belle Isle. Gale warnings are in effect for the remaining waters.\n\nSignificant wave heights of 10 to 15 metres are expected in offshore waters south of Nova Scotia this evening, and waters south of Newfoundland later tonight into Sunday morning. As the low continues east Sunday into Monday, waves of 4 to 7 metres will develop over eastern waters, and for the southwestern Grand Banks will build to 5 to 10 metres.\n\n\nForecasters: Borgel/Hatt\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-09-08T23:59:07-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-09-07T23:43:07-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2270726615.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Fredericton and Southern York County, Oromocto and Sunbury County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Stanley - Doaktown - Blackville Area, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Kouchibouguac National Park, Fundy National Park, Miramichi and area, Acadian Peninsula, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I., Avalon Peninsula North, Avalon Peninsula Southeast, St. John's and vicinity, Avalon Peninsula Southwest, Burin Peninsula, Connaigre, Burgeo - Ramea, Channel-Port aux Basques and vicinity, Corner Brook and vicinity, Deer Lake - Humber Valley, Gros Morne, Bay St. George, Buchans and the interior, Grand Falls-Windsor and vicinity, Bay of Exploits, Bonavista North, Bonavista Peninsula, Clarenville and vicinity, Gander and vicinity, Green Bay - White Bay, Terra Nova, Northern Peninsula East, Parson's Pond - Hawke's Bay, Port Saunders and the Straits, Red Bay to L'Anse-au-Clair, Norman Bay to Lodge Bay, Cartwright to Black Tickle, Eagle River, Chevery, Blanc-Sablon, Anticosti, Îles-de-la-Madeleine",
