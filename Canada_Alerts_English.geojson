Total snowfall amounts of 15 to 25 cm are possible with the heaviest snowfall occurring on Tuesday into Wednesday morning. \n\nIn addition to the snowfall, strong easterly winds gusting at times to 80 km/h, will combine with the falling snow to create reduced visibilities in blowing snow. These stronger wind gusts are expected Tuesday morning before diminishing by mid day Tuesday.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
