Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles.

New thunderstorms continue to develop on the western edge of the line.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2020-06-29T06:39:25-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-29T03:41:25-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2057856634.2020<br>Area: Riverdale Mun. incl.
