Overnight lows will remain in the low to mid twenties, offering little relief from the heat. \n\nShowers and thunderstorms on Wednesday may keep daytime high temperatures slightly cooler than the warning criteria. However the hot and humid air mass will remain in the place until the weekend. A cooler air mass may arrive by next Monday.\n\n###\n\nExtreme heat affects everyone.\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nWatch for the effects of heat illness: swelling, rash, cramps, fainting, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and the worsening of some health conditions.\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
