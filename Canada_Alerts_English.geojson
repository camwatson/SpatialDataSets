				"Summary" : "Description: Wet, windy and cold this weekend.\n\nLocation: West Coast of Newfoundland\n\nTime span: tonight through Friday night, with the possibility of another significant rainfall Saturday night.\n\nRemarks: An intensifying low pressure system is forecast to pass over western Newfoundland later today, and move into the Labrador Sea on Friday where it will remain nearly stationary through Saturday. Rain associated with this system will be light today, but intensify into heavier bands tonight as winds strengthen out of the northwest. Additional rainfall amounts of 30 to 40 are possible by Friday evening. \n\nLate tonight or early Friday morning, precipitation is expected to change to wet snow over higher terrain. Accumulations of 5 to 10 cm are possible on Friday over the highest terrain, but a light dusting of snow is also possible at lower elevations and driving could be impacted in some areas.\n\nAfter a reprieve from the wind and weather on Saturday afternoon, a second low pressure system is expected to pass through the Gulf of St. Lawrence Saturday night. While it is too early to predict rainfall amounts from this system, another significant rainfall seems likely during that period.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
