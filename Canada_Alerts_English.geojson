				"Summary" : "Description: Potential snow for the BC South Coast Thursday night\n\nWith the shift into cooler weather, snow is looking likely over the BC South Coast in the coming week. While there may be a few light flurries mixed with rain tonight, the first real opportunity for widespread low elevation snow is shaping up to be Thursday night.\n\nA low tracking south along the BC coast will spread moisture across the BC South Coast beginning Thursday evening. With temperatures hovering near the freezing mark, a mix of rain or snow is possible across the region. \n\nAs is frequently the case, snowfall amounts will vary across the region. Current estimates are that the Fraser Valley, and higher elevations of Metro Vancouver and Vancouver Island have the the potential for snowfall accumulations to exceed 5 cm Thursday night. \n\nThe snow is expected to change back to rain Friday morning. However, with temperatures remaining below seasonal normals into next week, the chance of more snow remains.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Lake effect snow squalls today.\n\nWith the passage of a strong cold front, isolated Lake Effect snow squalls have developed. Some of these snow squalls may give snowfall accumulations in excess of 15 centimetres by this evening. Strong winds gusting up to 60 km/h will combine with bursts of heavy snow to result in extensive blowing snow, particularly over open areas.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls are expected to develop. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nSnow squalls possible today.\n\nStrong northwesterly winds will result in the development of isolated snow squalls near Lake Huron and Georgian Bay.  At this point in time, the snow squalls are expected to remain south and east of the area.  However, if winds shift slightly, a snow squall warning may be required.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
