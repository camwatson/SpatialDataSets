As the system approaches the area today, light snow and southeasterly winds of 40 to 50 km/h will bring reduced visibilities in blowing snow for the day. \n\nHowever, much stronger winds are anticipated on Sunday once the system passes northeast of Iqaluit. There is potential for northwesterly winds of 60 gusting 80 km/h or more developing midday Sunday which will likely reduce visibilities to blizzard conditions. The strong winds are expected to continue into the evening before gradually diminishing on Monday morning. \n\nThe current forecast track of the system passes very close to Iqaluit, and as such the strength and exact timing of the strongest winds may change as the low approaches the area.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total amounts of 10 to 20 cm is expected.\n\nA Pacific weather system is spreading snow into central Saskatchewan today. This slowly moving low will track across southern Saskatchewan throughout the day and into Manitoba on Sunday. Most areas can expect 10 to 20 cm of snow by the time the system departs late Sunday, with the largest totals likely from the Lloydminster area east to the Manitoba border. Additionally, moderate northeasterly winds will accompany the snow today, causing visibilities to be reduced in blowing snow at times.\n\nLate this morning, radar indicates that the heaviest snow will fall to the north of Saskatoon and Kindersley. Saskatoon will likely end up with totals of 4 to 8 cm as they will be situated along the southern edge of the storm. \n\nThe accompanying cold front will move through southern portions of the province tonight bringing flurries with a risk of freezing rain.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Extreme cold tonight and Sunday morning.\n\nBitterly cold air with near-blizzard conditions remains in place over Kivalliq as a low pressure system crosses Hudson Bay and a ridge of high pressure builds to the west. With strong northwesterly winds up to 50 km/h continuing today, extreme cold wind chills of -55 to -60 will continue for most of the day and persist tonight. In addition, near-blizzard conditions can be expected for most of the day  before improving late this afternoon or tonight. Winds will gradually begin to diminish over the area tonight and temperatures will moderate on Sunday.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nWatch for cold related symptoms: shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle pain and weakness, numbness and colour change in fingers and toes.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
