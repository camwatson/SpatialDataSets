				"Summary" : "Description: For Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThe next information statement will be issued by 03:00 a.m. ADT.\n\nHurricane Dorian is expected to move into Atlantic Canada this \nweekend. \n\n1. Summary of basic information at 09:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: 30.7 North 79.8 West.\n\nAbout 239 kilometres south of Charleston.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 176 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: north at 15 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 961 millibars.\n\n\n2. Public weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nHigh winds and rainfall will be the major impacts, especially for the southern Maritimes and Newfoundland. There will also be high waves, especially for the Atlantic coasts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Finally, there is a chance that storm surge may affect parts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.\n\na. Wind.\n\nMost regions will see some tropical storm force winds, and near and south of the forecast track winds should reach hurricane force. As the storm moves into the Maritimes, there is the possibility of hurricane force northwesterlies behind the storm. Wind impacts may be enhanced by foliage on the trees, and may cause power outages.\n\nb. Rainfall.\n\nRainfall will be significant, especially north and west of Dorian's track. This suggests highest rainfall amounts are likely for the southern Maritimes and parts of Newfoundland, but some rain is likely over most regions. Amounts in excess of 50 mm are possible north and west of Dorian, and localised amounts near 100 mm are possible, especially for Nova Scotia. \n\nc. Surge/Waves.\n\nThere will also be some rough and pounding surf, especially for parts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Large waves will reach southwestern Nova Scotia on Saturday and build to near 10 metres over eastern Nova Scotia Saturday night. These waves will likely reach southern Newfoundland by Sunday morning. Waves near or higher than 5 metres will impact north facing coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Note that waves will break higher along the coast, and rip currents are likely. Please exercise extreme caution. Storm surge is possible, mainly for parts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland, but it is too early to be specific about which portions of the coastline may be affected. \n\n3. Marine weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nAs Hurricane Dorian moves into our waters, there is a good chance of hurricane force southeasterlies near and south of the track, mainly over southern Atlantic forecast waters. As the storm moves into the Maritimes, storm to hurricane force northwesterlies may develop behind it. Waves in excess of 12 metres are likely south of the storm track, beginning late Saturday over southwestern waters and approaching southern Newfoundland Sunday morning. \n\nForecasters: Couturier, Mercer, McArthur.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-09-06T05:37:31-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-09-04T23:38:31-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2611101630.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Fredericton and Southern York County, Oromocto and Sunbury County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Stanley - Doaktown - Blackville Area, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Kouchibouguac National Park, Fundy National Park, Miramichi and area, Acadian Peninsula, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I., Avalon Peninsula North, Avalon Peninsula Southeast, St. John's and vicinity, Avalon Peninsula Southwest, Burin Peninsula, Connaigre, Burgeo - Ramea, Channel-Port aux Basques and vicinity, Corner Brook and vicinity, Deer Lake - Humber Valley, Gros Morne, Bay St. George, Buchans and the interior, Grand Falls-Windsor and vicinity, Bay of Exploits, Bonavista North, Bonavista Peninsula, Clarenville and vicinity, Gander and vicinity, Green Bay - White Bay, Terra Nova, Northern Peninsula East, Parson's Pond - Hawke's Bay, Port Saunders and the Straits, Red Bay to L'Anse-au-Clair, Norman Bay to Lodge Bay, Cartwright to Black Tickle, Eagle River, Chevery, Blanc-Sablon, Anticosti, √éles-de-la-Madeleine",
