No new fires may be initiated and no additional material may be added to existing fires.  \n\nFor more information on burning restrictions, see the section below entitled ‘Mandatory Emission Reduction Actions.’ For more information on current air quality, see: \nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nExposure to air pollution is particularly a concern for children, the elderly, and those who have underlying medical conditions such as lung or heart disease.\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-11-05T04:53:05-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
