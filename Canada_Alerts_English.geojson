In the west and along parts of the Atlantic coast, the precipitation will start as rain and then change to snow early Sunday morning. At this time, the highest amounts are expected over eastern sections of the province where the snow will persist into the evening. General snowfall amounts of 5 to 15 cm are expected, with locally higher amounts possible over eastern regions. However, should the intensity or track of this system shift from what is currently expected, these amounts could change. \n\nAdditionally, strong northerly winds will develop later on Sunday, especially over the eastern half of the province, and combine with the fresh snow to create reduced visibility in blowing snow. The combination of snow and blowing snow could impact travel in parts of the province later on Sunday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
