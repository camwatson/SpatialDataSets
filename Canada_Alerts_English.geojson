North of this line the snow may turn over briefly to a mix of wet flurries and showers early this evening. \n\nAs cold arctic air returns again by Sunday, snow squalls in a brisk northwesterly flow off of Lake Huron are expected to affect the region starting Sunday morning. Snow squall watches may be issued as this event draws closer.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow will continue into Saturday with snowfall totals of 5 to 10 cm expected by Saturday evening. Higher amounts are expected over the Red River valley and southeastern Manitoba where warnings are currently in place.\n\nNorthwesterly winds up to 50 gusting 70 km/h will spread eastwards across southern Manitoba on Saturday night, combining with the falling snow to produce areas of reduced visibility in blowing snow which will persist through Saturday with improvement occurring Saturday night. \n\nWarnings are in place for numerous regions in southern Manitoba. Please stay alert for updated bulletins. Anyone who has plans to travel on area highways tonight or Saturday should ensure that they check local weather forecasts (https://weather.gc.ca/forecast/canada/index_e.html?id=mb) regional highway conditions (https://manitoba511.ca/en/) before travelling. Ensure that your vehicle contains a winter emergency kit (https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/sfttps/tp201012-en.aspx) in case poor travelling conditions cause you to be stranded for a period of time. Poor travelling conditions have also developed through the Dakotas and Minnesota, where this system is bringing higher snowfall accumulations along with strong winds.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-01-19T00:38:05-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-01-18T08:39:05-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1868922563.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Wallace-Woodworth incl.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA strong Pacific storm arrives tonight with a mix of wintery weather including snow, freezing rain, and blowing snow.\n\nThe storm will arrive tonight with snow beginning this evening across East and Central Vancouver Island. Total snowfall of 10 to 20 cm is expected by Saturday morning. However, local 5 to 10 cm are expected near sea level.\n\nStrong winds will also accompany the storm. As a result blowing snow is expected overnight tonight and early Saturday morning.\n\nAs warmer air associated with storm penetrates the region, the snow will likely transition to freezing rain over central Vancouver Island overnight tonight. \n\nA complete change over to rain is expected by Saturday morning for all regions. \n\nTiming this transition from snow to freezing rain is always challenging in these situations. There is a chance that this transition could be delayed resulting in higher snowfall amounts.\n\nStay tuned to the latest Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest warnings and forecasts.\n\n###\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
