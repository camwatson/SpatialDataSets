These thunderstorms may produce large hail, locally heavy downpours and strong wind gusts.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.<br>Expires: 2019-08-02T07:59:24-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-08-02T05:16:24-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1808959092.2019<br>Area: Mun. of Roblin incl.

These thunderstorms may produce large hail, locally heavy downpours and strong wind gusts.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.<br>Expires: 2019-08-02T06:59:31-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-08-02T04:07:31-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2050368331.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Hudson Bay including Hudson Bay and Reserve, R.M. of Preeceville including Preeceville and Sturgis, R.M. of Buchanan including Buchanan Amsterdam and Tadmore, R.M. of Good Lake including Canora and Good Spirit Lake Prov.
