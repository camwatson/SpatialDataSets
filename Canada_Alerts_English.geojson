				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total amounts of 10 to 20 cm is expected.\n\nA deepening Pacific low will make its way across Washington state on Monday. Abundant moisture associated with the system combined with cold air to the north of its trajectory will produce heavy snowfall across the southern interior of British Columbia. \n\nSnow will begin early Monday morning and intensify during the day. It will taper off Monday night. Snowfall amounts will range from 15 to 20 cm for the Nicola and Boundary regions. Snowfall will be more variable in the Okanagan where lower elevations along the lake may receive 10 cm or less; however, there will be 15 cm or more over higher terrain.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health. You can also visit the Direction régionale de santé publique du CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l’Île-de-Montréal at www.santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-12-20T21:59:26-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux, the Direction régionale de santé publique du CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l’Île-de-Montréal, the City of Montréal, 2020-12-20T10:01:26-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2884394668.2020<br>Area: Portneuf area, Valcartier - Stoneham area, Québec area, Côte-de-Beaupré - L'Île d'Orléans area, Bellechasse area, Lévis area, Saint-Lambert area, Lotbinière area, Lac-Etchemin area, Sainte-Marie-de-Beauce area, Saint-Georges-de-Beauce area, Montmagny - Saint-Jean-Port-Joli area, Saint-Fabien - Saint-Pamphile area",

It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.
