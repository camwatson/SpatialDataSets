Precipitation will likely begin as ice pellets before transitioning to snow late in the morning or early afternoon. The snow is then expected to taper off later in the afternoon to freezing drizzle or flurries. \n\nSome areas may see snow and ice pellet accumulations of 5 to 10 cm.  Some additional snowfall is possible later Sunday night with a few centimetres likely.\n\nStrong wind gusts up to 70 km/h and local blowing snow reducing visibilities are also possible.\n\nTravel on roads could become hazardous at times.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
