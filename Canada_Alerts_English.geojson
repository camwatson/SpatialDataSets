				"Summary" : "Description: Winter weather returns Tuesday night into Wednesday with an extended period of snow, freezing rain, and ice pellets. \n\nA low pressure system will bring a variety of winter precipitation for most of Newfoundland Tuesday night into Wednesday. Precipitation will begin as rain or snow in the southwest Tuesday evening and spread northeastwards throughout the night.  By Wednesday morning, precipitation will transition to ice pellets and freezing rain over the southern half of the Island. While parts of the south may transition back to rain later on Wednesday, wintry precipitation is expected to continue elsewhere for the most of the day. Then, after a brief lull Wednesday night, another round of mixed precipitation may potentially impact the Island Thursday and Friday.\n\nWhile it is too soon to provide precipitation amounts, significant snowfall and/or ice accumulation is possible by the end of the day on Wednesday. \n\nThe public is advised to monitor following forecasts as winter-related warnings will likely be issued.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
