				"Summary" : "Description: Potentially damaging winds tonight.\n\nWind gusts up to 90 km/h are likely tonight in the wake of strong cold front. These winds will diminish below warning criteria early Monday morning.\n\nThese strong winds will combine with flurries and local snow squalls to result in blowing snow and reduced visibilities at times.\n\n###\n\nDamage to buildings, such as to roof shingles and windows, may occur. High winds may toss loose objects or cause tree branches to break.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
