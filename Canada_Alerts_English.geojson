				"Summary" : "Description: Unseasonably warm weather expected for the start of the Canada Day weekend.\n\nSaturday and Sunday are shaping up to be sunny with afternoon cloudy periods and isolated afternoon showers on Sunday. Temperatures will be about 5 degrees above seasonal normals for the period. \n\nThis comes close to the Heat Warning criteria of at least 28 C for two or more consecutive days with an overnight low above 13 C. However, the amount of cloud cover, forest fire smoke and overnight cooling are still uncertain at this time and will play a major role in determining the temperatures.\n\nA Heat Warning may be issued later if conditions warrant. \n\n- Check the local news for health and safety updates.\n- Contact your local government to find out what services (such as air-conditioned buildings and public splash parks) are available in your area.   \n- Environment and Climate Change Canada and Regional Medical Health officers expect an increase in health and safety risks from heat and are advising the public to take precautions.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Loonie-sized hail has been reported with this storm.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Fast-moving water across a road can sweep a vehicle away. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2019-06-29T06:42:36-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-06-29T03:50:36-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3812604382.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Terrell including Spring Valley and Cardross, R.M. of Excel including Viceroy Ormiston and Verwood, R.M. of Elmsthorpe including Avonlea and Truax, R.M. of Key West including Ogema and Kayville",
