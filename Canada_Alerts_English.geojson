				"Summary" : "Description: Rain, snow and strong winds early next week.\n\nAn intense low pressure system will affect much of the province Monday afternoon through Wednesday.\n\nRainfall amounts of 20 to 40 millimetres are expected over Southern and Central Quebec. This rain will be accompanied by strong winds with temperatures well above normal.\n\nThe further east you go, the more rain is expected.   The Gaspé Peninsula and the North Shore could receive 50 to 80 millimetres of rain between Tuesday and Wednesday. There too, strong northeast winds combined with poor weather conditions could cause coastal flooding in some areas.\n\nAreas further north will receive about 10 centimetres of snow, except for the Manicouagan, which could receive about 20 centimetres of snow.\n\nFor now, it is still too early to give any specifics for the forecast. Subsequent weather statements will provide more information as the low pressure system's track becomes more certain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: High concentration of pollutants are expected and will result in poor air quality, especially in urban areas where pollutant emissions are higher.\n\nHigh levels of pollutants are expected to last until Saturday morning.\n\n###\n\nSmog especially affects asthmatic children and people with respiratory ailments or heart disease. It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health. You can also visit the Direction régionale de santé publique du CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l’Île-de-Montréal at www.santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-11-28T16:36:18-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux, the Direction régionale de santé publique du CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l’Île-de-Montréal, the City of Montréal, 2020-11-28T08:21:18-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1306173501.2020<br>Area: Louiseville area, Matawin - Mauricie National Park area, Lac-aux-Sables area, Shawinigan area, Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade area, Trois-Rivières area",
