This linear snow squall band will extend from Sachigo Lake to Red Lake late this morning and is expected to move eastward throughout the day reaching Webequie and Savant Lake by late afternoon.\n\nA snowfall accumulation of 4 to 8 cm is possible with this snow squall. Strong winds with gusts up to 60 km/h are also possible with the passage of the cold front today. These winds are expected to ease Friday evening.\n\nUnder the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will accumulate quickly. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to the reduced visibility.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls are expected to develop. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nA cold front moving across northern Ontario today, will bring southerly winds over lake Superior that may generate lake effect snow squalls. These snow squalls are expected to develop late this afternoon or this evening in an area stretching from Marathon east to Wawa and south to Agawa.\n\nHeavy bursts of snow and significantly reduced visibilities at times can be expected late this afternoon and tonight. Travel along Highway 17 during this time may be hazardous.\n\nA total snowfall accumulation of 10 to 15 cm is possible by Saturday morning. Areas closer the lake shore where the temperature is slightly above the freezing mark may accumulate less snow than areas further inland. \n\nThe snow squalls will begin to weaken near midnight for Marathon and Wawa and by Saturday morning for Agawa.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Poor visibility due to blowing snow is expected this afternoon and evening.\n\nHeavy snow and strong westerly winds with gusts of 70 to 80 km/h will affect the region beginning late this afternoon as an intense cold front moves east across northern Ontario today and tonight. The heavy snow and strong winds occurring together will result in blowing snow that will significantly reduce visibilities late this afternoon and this evening. \n\nAs the cold front moves east, the heavy snow will taper to flurries late in the evening, however the winds will remain strong and could continue to whip up the freshly fallen snow. Conditions are expected to improve early Saturday morning as the winds diminish.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlowing snow advisories are issued when winds are expected to create blowing snow giving poor visibility to 800 metres or less for at least 3 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
