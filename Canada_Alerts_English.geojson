				"Summary" : "Description: A strong Pacific storm is on the way for this afternoon and Friday for the BC coast.\n\nThe storm will approach the coast today. Precipitation spreads onto Vancouver Island late this morning and onto the south coast early this afternoon. Strong southeasterly winds will also develop this afternoon.\n\nInitially temperatures will be cold enough to allow some of the precipitation to start as wet snow over higher elevations of Vancouver Island and the south coast. \n\nBy this evening warm air accompanying the storm will drive freezing levels and temperatures higher so that precipitation changes to rain for most communities. The exception may be Whistler and the Sea to Sky Highway from Squamish to Whistler where snow could persist longer.\n\nThe heavy rain and strong winds continue all day on Friday. The highest rainfall amounts will be over the central coast, north and west Vancouver Island. Areas of Squamish, northern sections of Metro Vancouver, and the Fraser Valley will also significant amounts of rainfall.\n\nIn areas where snow does accumulate, a higher chance of localized flooding is possible due to rain on snow.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

These snow squalls are moving quickly from west to east-southeast.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nSnow squall warnings are issued when bands of snow form that produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
