Rain will fall over most of the highway with wet snow or rain mixed with snow near at summit.\n\nAs the cold front approaches tonight, precipitation rates will intensify and thus there is potential for snow levels to drop just below the summit or pass levels.\n\nTotal snow accumulations near 25 cm can be expected near the summit level by Monday morning.\n\nMotorists are advised to be aware of changing weather and road conditions due to fluctuating snow levels and precipitation intensity during this period.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.
