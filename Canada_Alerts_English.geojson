It may reach Attawapiskat and Fort Albany near or after midnight, although it will likely be in a weakened state by that time.\n\nA snowfall accumulation of 4 to 8 cm is possible with this snow squall. Strong winds with gusts of up to 60 km/h are also possible with the passage of the cold front tonight. These winds are expected to ease Friday overnight.\n\nUnder the snow squall bands, visibilities may be reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow.
