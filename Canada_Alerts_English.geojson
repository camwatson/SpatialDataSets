Currently the strongest band is located near Grand Bend through London and is moving to the southwest. Strong winds up to 60 km/h are expected causing areas of blowing snow. Snow squalls will weaken late this evening north of Goderich but persist into early Friday morning further south.\n\n###\n\nVisibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.
