Snow is expected to spread across the southern half of mainland Nova Scotia on Saturday afternoon, with most of the accumulation expected Saturday night. Snowfall warnings have been issued for Antigonish County, Guysborough County, and Cape Breton, but the latest forecast guidance is indicating much lower snowfall accumulations than previously expected further to the west. In addition, rain will likely mix with the snow along the Atlantic coast before the precipitation ends early Sunday morning, further reducing snowfall amounts there.\n\nThere is still some uncertainty in the track of this system, and a shift to the northwest could increase the snowfall over central Nova Scotia.  Additional information will be provided as the system approaches.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.

				"Summary" : "Description: High concentration of pollutants are expected and will result in poor air quality, especially in urban areas where pollutant emissions are higher.\n\nConcentrations of fine particulate matter are high and will remain so overnight tonight, through Saturday, and possibly on Sunday.\n\n###\n\nSmog especially affects asthmatic children and people with respiratory ailments or heart disease. It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.
