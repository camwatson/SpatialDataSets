				"Summary" : "Description: A snowfall to start the week.\n\nA low pressure system over the Northeastern United States will bring snow over Southern Quebec late in the afternoon on Monday. The snow will intensify in the evening and persist during the day on Tuesday, reaching Eastern Quebec.   The morning commute will be particularly difficult Tuesday morning.   10 to 15 centimetres of snow is expected over Southern and Central Quebec and possibly more in the Eastern Townships, the Beauce and Eastern Quebec.   The snow will be accompanied by strong winds over Central and Eastern Quebec, reducing visibilities in blowing snow.\n\nAccumulating snow will make travel difficult.\n\nHazardous driving conditions can be expected due to reduced visibilities.\n\nThe public is advised to monitor future forecasts for more information as the low pressure system's track becomes more certain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
