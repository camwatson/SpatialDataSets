The combination of these winds and the fact that we are currently in a period of medium tidal range could produce minor breaking sea conditions along the coast near these localities, at the dates and times specified (Eastern Daylight Time).\n\n\nRimouski - Mont-Joli: 2019-10-17, from 3 PM to 7 PM.\n\nMatane: 2019-10-17, from 3 PM to 7 PM.\n\nForillon Park - Gaspé - Percé: 2019-10-17, from 2 PM to 8 PM.\n\nNew-Carlisle - Chandler: 2017-10-17, from 3 PM to 7 PM.\n\n###\n\nCoastal flooding is possible along the shoreline.
