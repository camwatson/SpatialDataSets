				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nWinter storm to affect southern Manitoba beginning Tuesday morning. Storm total snowfall will be between 10-25 cm by Wednesday evening.\n\nA strong low pressure system will track along the international border Tuesday, bringing heavy snow, strong winds, and blowing snow to southern Manitoba. Heavy snow is expected to begin in the southwest Tuesday morning and spread eastward throughout the day and continue into Wednesday morning. A swath of 20-25 cm is likely from Minnedosa eastward to Bissett.\n\nIn addition to the snow, strong northerly winds, with gusts of 70-80 km/h, will develop with this system throughout Tuesday into the night. This will lead to visibility reductions in blowing snow lasting into Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThere will also be a risk of freezing rain over areas of Westman south of the Trans-Canada Highway Tuesday afternoon/evening. \n\n\nConditions will improve from west to east throughout Wednesday as the system departs the province.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Rapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nWinter storm to affect southern Saskatchewan starting Monday night. Storm total snowfall will be between 10-25 cm. \n\nA strong low pressure system will track along the international border Monday night bringing heavy snow to much of southern Saskatchewan. Snow will begin in the southwest Monday evening and spread eastward to the Manitoba border by Tuesday morning. A swath of 20-25 cm is expected through Tuesday evening, generally centred between the Trans-Canada and Yellowhead Highways. \n\nAlong with heavy snow, strong northerly winds of 50 km/h are expected to develop with this system, leading to a visibility reduction in blowing snow. The strong winds will first develop over western sections Tuesday morning and track eastward through the day. \n\nThere is also a risk of freezing rain over areas near the Trans-Canada Hwy and south toward the international border. Patchy freezing rain will begin over western sections early Tuesday morning and track eastward through the day.\n\nConditions will improve from west to east throughout Tuesday night into Wednesday morning.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nWinter storm to affect southern Manitoba beginning Tuesday morning. Storm total snowfall will be between 10-25 cm by Wednesday evening.\n\nA strong low pressure system will track along the international border Tuesday, bringing heavy snow, strong winds, and blowing snow to southern Manitoba. Heavy snow is expected to begin in the southwest Tuesday morning and spread eastward throughout the day and continue into Wednesday morning. A swath of 20-25 cm is likely from Minnedosa eastward to Bissett.\n\nIn addition to the snow, strong northerly winds, with gusts of 70-80 km/h, will develop with this system throughout Tuesday into the night. This will lead to visibility reductions in blowing snow lasting into Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThere will also be a risk of freezing rain over areas of Westman south of the Trans-Canada Highway Tuesday afternoon/evening. \n\n\nConditions will improve from west to east throughout Wednesday as the system departs the province.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Rapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-12-22T13:21:40-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-12-21T21:21:40-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2002160153.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Wallace-Woodworth incl.

Conditions will deteriorate further Tuesday night as the snow, at times heavy, will combine with strong northwesterly winds to produce reduced visibility in blowing snow.\n\nThe snow, wind, and blowing snow is expected to ease on Wednesday.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Abundant moisture associated with the system combined with cold air to the north of its trajectory will produce heavy snowfall across the southern interior of British Columbia. \n\nSnow will continue over southeastern British Columbia and become heavy this evening before tapering off Tuesday morning.\n\nTotal snowfall accumulations of 15 to 25 cm is expected for the Kootenays and Elk Valley. For higher elevations and highway passes like Kootenay Pass, amounts of up to 40 cm are possible. \n\nOver the southernmost regions, precipitation may briefly change over to rain this evening which will limit the snowfall amounts locally.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
