Conditions will become unfavourable for snow squalls by Thursday morning as a ridge of high pressure moves over the Maritimes.\n\nDriving conditions will become hazardous due to snow, blowing snow, and high winds.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
