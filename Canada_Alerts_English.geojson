These thunderstorms will have the potential to produce hail to the size of golf balls and wind gusts in excess of 100 km/h. \n\nThunderstorms are expected to last until late this evening before moving into Ontario.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
