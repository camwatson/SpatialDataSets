				"Summary" : "Description: High Storm Surge levels and large waves are expected to impact the coast.\n\nLocations: north facing shorelines from Notre Dame Bay to Ferryland.\n\nMaximum water levels: significantly exceeding high astronomical tide.\n\nMaximum wave heights: 7 to 10 metres, breaking upon approach to shore.\n\nTime span: midnight Friday night until Saturday afternoon.\n\nFirst high tide: after midnight Friday night.\nSecond high tide: early Saturday afternoon.\n\nRemarks: Higher than normal water levels along the east and northeast coasts due to 60 to 80 cm of storm surge combined with 7 to 10 m waves are expected. Flooding and damage to coastal infrastructure are possible, especially in communities exposed to the north. Highest water levels are expected near high tide Friday night and early Saturday afternoon.\n\n###\n\nHigh waves combined with the surge may cause damage along the coast. Coastal erosion is possible in vulnerable areas.\n\nStorm surge warnings are issued when water levels pose a threat to coastal regions.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A period of very cold wind chills is expected.\n\nExtreme wind chill values of -40 to -50 continue this morning.\n\nThe extreme wind chill values will begin to moderate today, for most regions, as a passing low brings warmer temperatures to the region. However, the cold will return for the weekend as more arctic air spills southeastwards across the region.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nWatch for cold related symptoms: shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle pain and weakness, numbness and colour change in fingers and toes.\n\nFor more information on cold and your health, visit Manitoba Health at https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/cold.html or call Health Links - Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

However, the cold will return on Friday night as more Arctic air spills southeastwards across the region. Once it returns, extreme cold will likely persist through the weekend.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nWatch for cold related symptoms: shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle pain and weakness, numbness and colour change in fingers and toes.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
