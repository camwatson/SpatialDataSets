				"Summary" : "Description: A series of disturbances tracking across the central prairies will usher a hot air mass into southern and central portions of Manitoba.\n\nThe hot air will begin to work its way into the region today and settle over the area throughout the weekend. Daytime temperatures in the low to mid thirties are expected for Saturday and Sunday with overnight lows in the upper teens or low twenties. A cold front tracking into Western Manitoba will likely bring some slight relieve to these regions over the later part of the weekend. However, over the Red River valley, Interlake and eastern portions of the province several guidance products are suggest that this heat wave could linger well into the middle of next week.\n\nThe public is advised to listen for possible warnings as heat warning criteria will likely be met over a number of areas.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Daytime temperatures in the low to mid thirties are expected for Saturday and Sunday with overnight lows in the upper teens or low twenties. A cold front tracking into Western Manitoba will likely bring some slight relieve to these regions over the later part of the weekend. However, over the Red River valley, Interlake and eastern portions of the province several guidance products are suggest that this heat wave could linger well into the middle of next week.\n\nThe public is advised to listen for possible warnings as heat warning criteria will likely be met over a number of areas.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility. Smoke is expected or occurring.\n\nHigh levels of air pollution are expected for the next few days due to smoke from forest fires. The smoke plumes from the large forest fires in the Chute-des-Passes area may affect neighbouring regions. Air quality could deteriorate if the smoke mixes down to ground level.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nIf your home is not air-conditioned, be sure the house doesn't get too warm when doors and windows are closed to keep out smoke. Exposure to too much heat can also result in illness.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-06-27T02:41:17-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-26T10:42:17-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0579674355.2020<br>Area: Manic-5 area, Manic-3 area, Chutes-des-Passes - Pipmuacan Reservoir area, Labrieville area",
