Widespread snow will transition to more localized/variable lake effect snow squalls Friday morning. \n\nDiscussion:\nRain will continue through Thursday morning before switching over to snow from west to east. Snow may be occasionally heavy at times overnight into Friday morning, before giving way to a lake effect snow squall event. Lake effect snow should last into Saturday, and will be accompanied by local whiteouts at times in heavy and blowing snow. \n\nA Snow Squall Watch will likely be needed for areas east of Lake Huron and southeast of Georgian Bay to address this concern for Friday and Saturday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Significant rainfall expected Thursday into Friday morning. There is also the risk of freezing rain or ice pellets.\n\nRain is forecast to develop over the region Thursday morning. This rain is then expected to continue through Thursday night. Total rainfall amounts of 25 to 40 mm are possible with this event. \n\nBy Friday morning, Christmas Day, the rain is expected to change to scattered flurries or periods of snow as temperatures drop to below the freezing mark. There may also be a period of freezing rain or ice pellets during the transition. A few centimetres of snow will be possible.\n\nThis rain is associated with a strong low pressure system that will approach the area from the south Thursday. There remains some uncertainty as to the exact track of this low pressure system. Areas may transition to snow earlier than currently forecast, changing associated precipitation amounts.\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is a possible as the frozen ground has a reduced ability to absorb rainfall. \n\nRainfall Warnings may be required as the event draws closer. Some regions may require freezing rain warnings during the storm.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
