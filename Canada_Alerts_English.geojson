				"Summary" : "Description: Heavy snowfall with blowing snow is expected.\n\nAdditional snowfall: 5 to 10 cm tonight.\n\nMaximum wind gusts: northwesterly 80 km/h, except 100 km/h in the Bonavista area.\n\nTime span: continuing until late tonight.\n\nRemarks: Snow, at times heavy, will begin again this evening and continue through much of the night tonight. Winds will increase from the northeast with gusts to 70 km/h along parts of the coast this evening, before shifting to strong northwesterly winds gusting to 80 to 100 km/h early Christmas morning.\n\nWhile the snow will ease overnight tonight, the strong northwesterly winds will persist through Christmas Day and Boxing Day, causing blowing snow at times.\n\nIn addition, a second round of steadier snow, possibly heavy, is expected to develop by the afternoon on Boxing Day. Further details on accumulations for this period will be provided as more information becomes available.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
