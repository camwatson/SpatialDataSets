The threat for severe thunderstorms will diminish during the early morning hours.\n\n###\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

This threat of thunderstorms will continue throughout the night as the system starts to tap into hot and humid air originating from the Dakotas. The threat for severe thunderstorms will diminish during the early morning hours.\n\n###\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Late season snow over highway passes overnight through Friday morning\n\nA cold upper trough moving through British Columbia will give some late season flurries to the mountain passes and northern British Columbia overnight and Friday morning.\n\nFlurries are expected above 1300-1500m elevation, however flurries could briefly descend lower during periods of intense flurry activity. Most southern highway passes are forecast to receive about 2 to 5 cm of wet snow overnight through Friday morning with a locally higher amount up to 10 cm possible over the Okanagan Connector.  \n\nOver northern BC, the Alaska Highway (Highway 97) from the Rocky Mountain foothills to the Liard River can also expect flurries overnight.\n\nPrecipitation will change back to rain on Friday as the airmass begins to warm.\n\nMotorists and those venturing outdoors are encouraged to be prepared for winter-like conditions.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-06-07T15:03:32-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-06-07T07:04:32-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1288496425.2019<br>Area: Highway 3 - Hope to Princeton via Allison Pass, Highway 3 - Paulson Summit to Kootenay Pass, Highway 97 - Pine Pass, Coquihalla Highway - Hope to Merritt, Coquihalla Highway - Merritt to Kamloops, Okanagan Connector - Merritt to Kelowna, Trans-Canada Highway - Eagle Pass to Rogers Pass, Yellowhead Highway – Tête Jaune Cache to the Alberta Border",
