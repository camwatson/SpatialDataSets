				"Summary" : "Description: A cold front that swept through Alberta Friday afternoon is now moving into southwestern Saskatchewan as of early this evening.  Numerous reports of winds gusting in excess of 100 km/h were reported as the front crossed Alberta, and very gusty northwest winds are expected tonight in the wake of this feature as it moves through Saskatchewan. The wind is not expected to be quite as strong as the cold front moves through the province, but many areas in southern Saskatchewan will still see gusts of 80 to 100 km/h tonight.\n\nMuch colder temperatures are expected Saturday in the wake of the cold front.\n\n###\n\nDamage to buildings, such as to roof shingles and windows, may occur. Loose objects may be tossed by the wind and cause injury or damage.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
