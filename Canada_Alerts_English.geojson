				"Summary" : "Description: Occasional heavy rain for the Central Interior today though Thursday. \n\nGuidance continues to suggest that 20 to 40 mm of rain is possible through Thursday. Higher rainfall amounts expected over the mountains, especially over the Williston and McGregor regions. However, there remains some uncertainty about just how much rain will fall during this prolonged event. In addition to the widespread synoptic rain, thunderstorms will have the potential of adding 15-25 mm over short periods.\n\nA low pressure system over southern Alberta this morning will move northward into central Alberta by evening. The system will funnel rain across the central interior.\n\nThe rain will taper off on Thursday morning, but some showers are likely to persist until Thursday afternoon.  \n\nThere is also significant concern for moderate rain and flows in the Quesnel River (Cariboo Mountains), the North Thompson (Blue River/Clearwater region), and South Thompson (Shuswap). Although the rainfall amounts may not be exceptionally heavy, the severity of this event is due to the potential of rising rivers levels.\n\nRainfall warnings may be issued as the system further develops and confidence in rainfall amounts increases.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The higher end of the range will occur near the eastern slopes of the Rockies. Locally in the Rockies, rainfall amounts may exceed 90 mm during the event. \n\nOver Muncho Lake Park-Stone Mountain park, 40 to 80 mm of rainfall is forecast for the event with the higher end of the range occurring over eastern sections over communities like Tetsa River.\n\nThe heavy rain is being caused by low pressure centre drifting northwards through Alberta today. Strong and moist easterly flow associated with the low will cause enhanced precipitation as the flow encounters the eastern slopes of the Rockies. \n\nOn Thursday the low will weaken somewhat and stall near the AB-BC border. The character of the precipitation will become more showery. But widespread thunderstorms will develop Thursday afternoon and continue Thursday evening. These storms will cause local downpours that will contribute to storm rainfall totals well into Thursday night.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The higher end of the range will occur near the eastern slopes of the Rockies. Locally in the Rockies, rainfall amounts may exceed 90 mm during the event. \n\nOver Muncho Lake Park-Stone Mountain park, 40 to 80 mm of rainfall is forecast for the event with the higher end of the range occurring over eastern sections over communities like Tetsa River.\n\nThe heavy rain is being caused by low pressure centre drifting northwards through Alberta today. Strong and moist easterly flow associated with the low will cause enhanced precipitation as the flow encounters the eastern slopes of the Rockies. \n\nOn Thursday the low will weaken somewhat and stall near the AB-BC border. The character of the precipitation will become more showery. But widespread thunderstorms will develop Thursday afternoon and continue Thursday evening. These storms will cause local downpours that will contribute to storm rainfall totals well into Thursday night.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
