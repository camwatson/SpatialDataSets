				"Summary" : "Description: Occasional heavy rain for the Central Interior today though Thursday. \n\nGuidance continues to suggest that 20 to 40 mm of rain is possible through Thursday. Higher rainfall amounts expected over the mountains, especially over the Williston and McGregor regions. However, there remains some uncertainty about just how much rain will fall during this prolonged event. In addition to the widespread synoptic rain, thunderstorms will have the potential of adding 15-25 mm over short periods.\n\nA low pressure system over southern Alberta this morning will move northward into central Alberta by evening. The system will funnel rain across the central interior.\n\nThe rain will taper off on Thursday morning, but some showers are likely to persist until Thursday afternoon.  \n\nThere is also significant concern for moderate rain and flows in the Quesnel River (Cariboo Mountains), the North Thompson (Blue River/Clearwater region), and South Thompson (Shuswap). Although the rainfall amounts may not be exceptionally heavy, the severity of this event is due to the potential of rising rivers levels.\n\nRainfall warnings may be issued as the system further develops and confidence in rainfall amounts increases.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-02T02:51:36-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-01T10:52:36-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1666902665.2020<br>Area: South Thompson, Shuswap, North Thompson, North Columbia, Cariboo - north including Quesnel, Cariboo - south including Williams Lake, 100 Mile, Yellowhead, Williston, Prince George, McGregor",
