Beginning today over the Outaouais, the heat wave will move to settle north of Montreal beginning Tuesday. Temperatures will exceed the 30-degree mark during the day and will not fall below 18 degrees at night. Combined values of the temperature and the humidity will give a humidex value of 40.  \n\nThese conditions may persist into Friday.  \n\nDuring times of high heat, your health and the health of your family and friends can deteriorate rapidly.  \n\nThe ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux du Québec, in cooperation with Environment and Climate Change Canada, recommends that you protect yourself from the effects of the heat by taking the following actions:  \n\nDrink 6 to 8 glasses of water per day. As appropriate, follow your physician's instructions regarding the amount of fluid to drink; Avoid alcoholic beverages; Spend at least 2 hours a day in an air conditioned or cool place; Take at least one cool shower or bath per day, or cool your skin several times per day with wet towels; Limit physical activity; Wear light clothes.  \n\nBe sure to: \nNever leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle or a poorly ventilated room, even for a few minutes; Check on your loved ones, especially those who are vulnerable or living alone.  \n\nIf you have any questions regarding your health, call Info-Santé by dialing 8-1-1 or ask a health care provider. In case of emergency, call 9-1-1.  \n\nFor more information, visit the Government of Quebec's Portail santé mieux-être at www.sante.gouv.qc.ca.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
