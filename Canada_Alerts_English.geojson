Some areas along the south and east coasts could see gusts approach 100 km/h.\n\nRemarks: The cause of this disruption to our lack of winter weather will be a deep low pressure system passing near the Avalon Peninsula.  Snow will begin on Tuesday evening and persist in some areas until Wednesday afternoon. Temperatures are expected to be near zero, which means areas along the coast may see the snow mix with or change completely over to rain.  Unfortunately, this also means the snow is likely going to be rather wet and heavy.  We will also likely see a period of freezing rain and ice pellets over the easternmost regions Tuesday night into Wednesday morning.\n\nExtra considerations for the Clarenville area and the Bonavista Peninsula:  These areas are expected to be right along the snow-rain line.  If the storm track shifts further northwest, precipitation in these areas could easily be mostly rain, with up to 30 mm possible instead of snow.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
