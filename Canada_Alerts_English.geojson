The most intense bands are likely Tuesday afternoon and evening. \n\nWinds will become southwest by Wednesday morning, shifting the snow squalls to mainly affect Bruce and Grey Counties on Wednesday. \n\nGusty winds will accompany these bands at times resulting in periods of blowing snow.\n\nLocal snowfall accumulations of 10 to 15 cm will be possible under the most intense bands by Wednesday morning.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
