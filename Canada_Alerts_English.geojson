				"Summary" : "Description: Significant Snow Possible Today \n\nA favourable set up for low elevation snow over the south coast is shaping up for today and tonight. A front will track down the BC coast beginning this morning and combine with a cool airmass to produce snow across the south coast lowlands.\n\nSnowfall amounts will vary significantly across Vancouver Island. The air will be cool, but not truly Arctic, so snowfall amounts will vary with proximity to the water, elevation and intensity of precipitation. \n\nOver Inland Vancouver Island, 5 to 10 cm of heavy, wet snow is expected by this afternoon. Over higher elevations of the inland highways 10 cm of snow is possible.  Warmer air will arrive this afternoon and the snow should transition to rain throughout the region.  \n\nHowe Sound will see 10 to 15 cm of total accumulation by tonight. \n\nPrecipitation should be rain everywhere across the south coast lowlands by  Wednesday as a flow of milder Pacific air returns.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total amounts of 5 to 20 cm is expected today and tonight.\n \nA favourable set up for widespread low elevation snow over the south coast is shaping up for today and tonight. A front is tracking down the BC coast  this morning and combining with a cool airmass to produce snow across the lowlands.  \n\nSnowfall amounts will vary significantly across the region. The air will be cool, but not truly Arctic, so snowfall amounts will vary with proximity to the water, elevation and intensity of precipitation. \n\nAnywhere from 5 to 20 cm of heavy, wet snow is expected. The highest amounts are expected over the northern and inland sections of Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley where the snow will persist the longest, until tonight or Wednesday morning. \n\nWarmer air will arrive faster over Sunshine Coast, East Vancouver Island, and the southwestern sections of Metro Vancouver and the transition to rain there will start this afternoon or evening. \n\nPrecipitation should be rain everywhere across the south coast lowlands by Wednesday as a flow of milder Pacific air returns.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. There may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted.  Exposure is particularly a concern for infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-02-05T12:24:32-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
