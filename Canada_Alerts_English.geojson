Flooding and damage to coastal infrastructure are possible, especially in locations exposed to the north. Highest water levels are expected near high tide Friday night and early Saturday afternoon.\n\n###\n\nHigh waves combined with the surge may cause damage along the coast. Coastal erosion is possible in vulnerable areas.\n\nStorm surge warnings are issued when water levels pose a threat to coastal regions.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
