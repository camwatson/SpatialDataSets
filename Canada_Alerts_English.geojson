Freezing rain may create hazardous conditions over Cape Breton Thursday night into Friday morning. On Friday the area of precipitation will have moved out of the province, however strong northwesterly winds in flurries will likely persist in onshore winds from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence giving reduced visibilities in snow and blowing snow.
