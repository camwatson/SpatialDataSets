The combination of these winds and the fact that we are currently in a period of high tidal range will cause minor coastal flooding along the coast near these localities, on the dates and at the times specified (Eastern standard time).\n\nQuebec City: 2020-11-16, from 05:00 PM to 08:00 PM.\n\n###\n\nStorm surge warnings are issued when water levels pose a threat to coastal regions.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
