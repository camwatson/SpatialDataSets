Total rainfall amounts could be as high as 75 mm, before coming to an end on Friday. This warning may be expanded as more information becomes available.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Localized flooding in low-lying areas is possible. Be prepared for possible winter conditions at higher elevations.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
