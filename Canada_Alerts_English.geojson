Stormy conditions will then persist through today, especially in the Natuashish area. Conditions will improve by this evening over all locations as the snow tapers to flurries and the winds begin to ease.\n\n###\n\nVisibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Rain, at times heavy, is expected.\n\nHeavy rain is expected for the coastal sections of the Central Coast and North and West Vancouver Island. An atmospheric river will take aim at Vancouver Island and the Central Coast beginning early Saturday morning delivering heavy rain and mild conditions until mid-day Sunday. Rainfall amounts of 100 to 120 mm are expected by Sunday morning for the aforementioned regions.\n\nGiven the tropical origin of the atmospheric river, freezing levels will be on the rise upwards of 3000 metres for the South Coast and close to 2500 metres for the North Coast. The mild air will result in rain at almost all elevations. High runoff and rising river levels are likely through the weekend.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
