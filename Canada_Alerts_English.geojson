Gusty winds will accompany these snow squalls at times resulting in periods of blowing snow.\n\nThese snow squalls are expected to slowly shift southward as the wind becomes northwesterly by this evening. Additional snowfall accumulations of 15 cm are possible tonight.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Road closures are possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
