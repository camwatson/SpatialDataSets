The sudden onset of snow with strong winds will likely create visibilities near zero in blowing snow for a brief period of time as the front passes.\n\nVisibilities will improve late this evening in the wake of the front.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
