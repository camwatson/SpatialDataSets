				"Summary" : "Description: At 9:43 p.m. CDT, Environment Canada meteorologists are tracking a severe thunderstorm capable of producing very strong wind gusts, up to nickel size hail and heavy rain.\n\nA north to south line of thunderstorms has developed just to the west of the Ontario-Manitoba border and is expected to move into the area around 11 CDT. \nThis line of thunderstorms may become severe and produce strong and gusty winds reaching up to 110 km/h. Torrential downpours and large hail with a diameter of 2 cm are also possible.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.<br>Expires: 2020-06-18T05:00:34-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-18T02:44:34-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1023298652.2020<br>Area: Red Lake - Woodland Caribou Park, Kenora - Grassy Narrows - Whitedog, Sioux Narrows - Nestor Falls - Morson",
