Colder air will usher in behind this system later on Friday and persist on Saturday. As this colder air arrives from the northwest, showers will turn to periods of snow Friday evening which could give local accumulations and potentially hazardous driving conditions especially to the Annapolis Valley, northern Nova Scotia and parts of Cape Breton Island. \n\nSaturday will be a cold and blustery day across the entire province with onshore flurries and temperatures struggling to climb above zero in many areas.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
