Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2019-07-08T02:39:38-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-08T00:08:38-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1127086121.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Hudson Bay including Shoal Lake and Red Earth Reserves",
