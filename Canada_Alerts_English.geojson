Conditions will deteriorate further Tuesday night as the snow, at times heavy, will combine with strong northwesterly winds to produce reduced visibility in blowing snow.\n\nThe snow, wind, and blowing snow is expected to ease on Wednesday.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.

				"Summary" : "Description: High concentration of pollutants are expected and will result in poor air quality, especially in urban areas where pollutant emissions are higher.\n\nHigh concentrations of air pollutants should persist through noon Tuesday.\n\n###\n\nSmog especially affects asthmatic children and people with respiratory ailments or heart disease. It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health. You can also visit the Direction régionale de santé publique du CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l’Île-de-Montréal at www.santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-12-23T00:24:40-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux, the Direction régionale de santé publique du CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l’Île-de-Montréal, the City of Montréal, 2020-12-22T02:30:40-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3618353351.2020<br>Area: Mont-Tremblant - Sainte-Agathe area, Sainte-Adèle - Saint-Sauveur area, Saint-Jérôme area, Lachute area, Saint-Eustache area, Longueuil - Varennes area, Laval area, Montréal Island area, Châteauguay - La Prairie area, Soulanges area, Vaudreuil area, Saint-Rémi area, Valleyfield - Beauharnois area, Hemmingford area, Huntingdon area, Berthierville - Saint-Gabriel area, Rawdon - Joliette area, Mascouche area, Louiseville area, Matawin - Mauricie National Park area, Lac-aux-Sables area, Shawinigan area, Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade area, Trois-Rivières area, Portneuf area, Valcartier - Stoneham area, Québec area, Côte-de-Beaupré - L'Île d'Orléans area, Bellechasse area, Lévis area, Saint-Lambert area, Lotbinière area, Sorel - Yamaska area, Saint-Hyacinthe - Acton Vale area, Verchères - Beloeil area, Saint-Jean - Marieville area, Lacolle area, Bécancour - Villeroy area, Victoriaville area, Nicolet area, Drummondville area, Granby - Waterloo area, Brome-Missisquoi area, Richmond area, Weedon area, Thetford Mines area, Mont-Orford - Lake Memphrémagog area, Sherbrooke area, Coaticook area, Lac-Mégantic area, Cookshire area, Lac-Etchemin area, Sainte-Marie-de-Beauce area, Saint-Georges-de-Beauce area, Montmagny - Saint-Jean-Port-Joli area, Saint-Fabien - Saint-Pamphile area",
