This line is moving eastward towards the Ontario border.  In addition, a few isolated thunderstorms are developing ahead of this line.  Torrential rainfall with localized flooding, loonie size hail and wind gusts to 90 km/h have been reported with these thunderstorms.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Large hail can damage property and cause injury.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, damaging hail and heavy rain.\n\nThunderstorms are moving eastwards across southwestern Manitoba this morning. Some of these thunderstorms will likely be severe, capable of damaging hail, strong winds, and torrential rainfall. Flash flooding can be expected.\n\nThe activity will move out of the region on Friday morning, but another round of severe thunderstorm activity will develop later in the day, potentially impacting far southeastern Saskatchewan into southern Manitoba.\n\n###\n\nFast-moving water across a road can sweep a vehicle away. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
