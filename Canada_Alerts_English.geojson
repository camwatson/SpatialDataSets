Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops.

This thunderstorm is moving slowly eastward.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.<br>Expires: 2020-07-13T03:43:19-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-13T00:46:19-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1670951198.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Lacadena including Kyle Tyner and Sanctuary, R.M. of Victory including Beechy, R.M. of King George northwest of Lucky Lake, R.M. of Monet including Elrose Wartime and Forgan",

Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2020-07-13T03:02:05-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-13T00:20:05-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3462107795.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Tullymet including Peepeekisis Res., R.M. of Abernethy including Balcarres and Abernethy, R.M. of Invermay including Invermay and Rama, R.M. of Insinger including Theodore and Sheho, R.M. of Foam Lake including Foam Lake and Fishing Lake Res., R.M. of Ituna Bon Accord including Ituna and Hubbard",
