				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions will be favourable for the development of funnel clouds today.\n\n\n###\n\nThese types of funnel clouds are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nLandspout tornadoes do not usually cause significant damage but can still be dangerous. They can be strong enough to topple trees, damage roofs or toss debris short distances.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ABstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ABStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-08T07:06:36-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-07T23:12:36-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2708231779.2020<br>Area: Mountain View Co. near Sundre, Mountain View Co. near Olds and Didsbury, Mountain View Co. near Cremona and Water Valley, Mountain View Co. near Carstairs and Stirlingville, Rocky View Co. near Airdrie and Crossfield, Rocky View Co. near Bottrel and Madden, Rocky View Co. near Cochrane, Kneehill Co. near Torrington and Wimborne, Kneehill Co. near Trochu and Huxley, Kneehill Co. near Three Hills, Kneehill Co. near Acme and Linden, Kneehill Co. near Carbon, Starland Co. near Rumsey and Rowley, Starland Co. near Morrin and Munson, Starland Co. near Michichi and Delia, Wheatland Co. near Rockyford and Rosebud, Wheatland Co. near Hwys 569 and 848, Town of Drumheller, Rocky View Co. near Irricana Beiseker and Kathyrn, S.A. 2 near Finnegan and Little Fish Lake Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions will be favourable for the development of funnel clouds today.\n\n\n###\n\nThese types of funnel clouds are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nLandspout tornadoes do not usually cause significant damage but can still be dangerous. They can be strong enough to topple trees, damage roofs or toss debris short distances.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ABstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ABStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-08T07:06:12-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-08T00:06:12-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0491208690.2020<br>Area: Lacombe Co. near Eckville, Lacombe Co. near Lacombe Blackfalds and Bentley, Lacombe Co. near Clive Alix and Mirror, Red Deer Co. near Sylvan Lake and Stephansson House, Red Deer Co. near Spruce View and Red Lodge Prov.

This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nLandspout tornadoes do not usually cause significant damage but can still be dangerous. They can be strong enough to topple trees, damage roofs or toss debris short distances.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of very dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing destructive wind gusts, damaging hail and heavy rain.\n\nA significant line of severe thunderstorms has developed over southwestern Saskatchewan and is ongoing. The threat for tornadoes has diminished, however there is still the risk for the development of a tornado embedded in the line while the thunderstorms are ongoing.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Widespread and extremely strong wind gusts can destroy buildings with tornado-like damage, flatten large stands of trees and blow vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of very dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing destructive wind gusts, damaging hail and heavy rain.\n\nA significant line of severe thunderstorms has developed over southwestern Saskatchewan and is ongoing. The threat for tornadoes has diminished, however there is still the risk for the development of a tornado embedded in the line while the thunderstorms are ongoing.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Widespread and extremely strong wind gusts can destroy buildings with tornado-like damage, flatten large stands of trees and blow vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
