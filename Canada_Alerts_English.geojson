				"Summary" : "Description: Sunday will be unseasonably hot.\n\nTemperatures had reached 30 C over the central and western Yukon this afternoon. Conditions look to be on track for tonight and Sunday to meet the criteria for a Heat Warning. Daytime highs are expected to reach near 29 C with the overnight low falling to near 13 C. This puts temperatures about 5 to 7 degrees above seasonal norms. Cooler weather returns on Monday.\n\nHowever, there are some competing factors such as, afternoon cloud cover, possible showers, and forest fire smoke, that may throw a wrench into the forecast. \n\nHeat warnings are issued when daytime highs are forecast to reach at least 28 C for two consecutive days and the overnight low doesn't fall below 13 C.\n\n###\n\nTo get more information:\n- Check the local news for health and safety updates. \n- Check HealthLinkBC online resources about heat-related illness and how to protect yourself at www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthlinkbc-files/heat-related-illness. \n- Call HealthLinkBC at 8-1-1 to ask about heat-related illness.\n\nEnvironment Canada and local Medical Health Officers expect an increase in health and safety risks from heat and are advising the public to take precautions.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather in British Columbia or Yukon, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or YTstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm or #YTStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-06-30T20:21:30-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-06-30T04:22:30-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1325374675.2019<br>Area: Dawson, Mayo, Beaver Creek, Pelly - Carmacks",
