				"Summary" : "Description: Rain and warm temperatures today followed by freezing rain and ice pellets on Sunday.\n\nTotal rainfall: 10-20 mm.\n\nFreezing rain: significant ice accretion possible, especially over the Fundy region and southwestern areas.\n\nWinds: gusts to 70-80 km/h in the Fundy and Tantramar Marsh region today. Widespread gusts to 50 km/h on Sunday.\n\nLocations: southern New Brunswick.\n\nTime span: early Sunday morning into Sunday evening.\n\nRemarks: Periods of freezing rain this morning will change to rain as temperatures climb well above the freezing mark this morning. Periods of rain will then continue into the overnight hours then change to freezing rain early Sunday morning then over to ice pellets for more central areas Sunday afternoon as temperatures fall rapidly during the day. For the Fundy region and southwestern areas, precipitation on Sunday is expected to fall primarily as freezing rain.\n\nSignificant impacts from these changing precipitation types are likely.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and hazardous.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Gusts \nof 40 km/h on Sunday over northern areas.\n\nLocations: Nova Scotia except southwestern most areas and northern Cape Breton.\n\nTime span: overnight tonight into Sunday, then ending Sunday evening.\n\nRemarks: rain and very mild temperatures associated with a brisk southwest wind can be expected today and this evening. However, temperatures will fall rapidly overnight tonight over northern areas of the province and over most other areas of the province early Sunday morning. Rain will change to freezing rain or ice pellets over much of the province by early Sunday morning. These conditions are expected to persist throughout the day Sunday. \n\nSignificant impacts from these changing precipitation types are likely.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Utility outages may occur.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Freezing rain warnings may be needed in some areas as this event draws closer.\n\nStrong southwest winds gusting to 80 km/h will herald the end of the precipitation Sunday morning.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The frozen ground has a reduced ability to absorb this rainfall.\n\nA moisture laden low from Texas will bring a significant heavy rainfall event to Southern and Eastern Ontario Saturday. \n\nRain is expected to become continuous and heavy at times overnight then continue Saturday. Total rainfall amounts of 30 to 50 mm are anticipated by Saturday evening.\n\nSince the ground is frozen, the winter rainfall warning criterion of 25 mm in 24 hours is being met.  \n\nThe rain may change over to freezing rain late Saturday afternoon or Saturday evening as temperatures dip to near the zero degree mark. Freezing rain warnings may be needed as this event draws closer.\n\nFor information concerning flooding, please consult your local conservation authority or Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry district office.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Rainfall, combined with melting snow, is expected. The frozen ground has a reduced ability to absorb this rainfall.\n\nA soaker on tap Saturday. \n\nA moisture laden low from Texas will spread rain across Eastern Ontario overnight into Saturday, with most areas receiving a total of 20 to 30 mm by Saturday evening. The rain is then expected to change over to freezing rain Saturday evening as temperatures slide down to the zero degree mark.\n\nSince the ground is frozen, the winter rainfall warning criterion of 25 mm in 24 hours is being met.  \n\nFor information concerning flooding, please consult your local conservation authority or Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry district office.\n\nFreezing rain may last for several hours Saturday night before becoming mixed with ice pellets or a couple cm of snow Sunday. Significant ice accretion of 10 to 20 mm is possible Saturday night from the freezing rain. Freezing rain warnings will likely be issued as this event draws closer. \n\nBrisk northerly winds Sunday are also possible. These winds coupled with ice build up on tree branches and power lines could cause a few power outages. \nWarnings will be issued as the event draws nearer.  \n\nTravel will be impacted throughout Southern Ontario Saturday into Sunday.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
