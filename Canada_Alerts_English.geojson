In the west and along parts of the Atlantic coast, the precipitation will start as rain and then change to snow early Sunday morning. At this time, the highest amounts are expected over eastern sections of the province where the snow will persist into the evening. General snowfall amounts of 5 to 15 cm are expected, with locally higher amounts possible over eastern regions. However, should the intensity or track of this system shift from what is currently expected, these amounts could change. \n\nAdditionally, strong northerly winds will develop later on Sunday, especially over the eastern half of the province, and combine with the fresh snow to create reduced visibility in blowing snow. The combination of snow and blowing snow could impact travel in parts of the province later on Sunday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The snow will then become heavy in the evening and persist overnight. Accumulations of 20 to 40 cm are forecast by dawn on Monday, with the highest amounts over the northeastern Avalon. \n\nSlightly lesser accumulations are expected along the southern shore and parts of the southern Avalon as the snow is expected to mix with ice pellets Sunday evening. \n\nSnow and blowing snow will result in reduced visibility which may impact Monday morning commuters. Whiteout conditions are expected over exposed areas overnight and into Monday morning. Conditions are expected to begin improve near noon on Monday.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
