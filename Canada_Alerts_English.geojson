				"Summary" : "Description: An intense low pressure system will bring significant amounts of rain beginning Monday evening through Tuesday evening over Southern and Central Quebec.\n\nFurther north, snowfall amounts of 15 to 25 centimetres are possible from Monday morning to Tuesday evening in a corridor stretching from Abitibi towards Chaleur Bay, including Quebec City. Snow accompanied by moderate winds may reduce visibilities locally in blowing snow.\n\nFreezing rain is likely in the vicinity of the snow-to-rain transition area. A more important episode of freezing rain is also likely for areas of the St. Lawrence Valley between Montreal and Quebec City. Travel could be difficult, especially at rush hour Tuesday morning.\n\nThere is still much uncertainty about the track of this system and thus about the type and amount of precipitation expected.\n\nPlease stay tuned for future forecasts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Freezing rain is expected or occurring.\n\nA cold front moving through southern Saskatchewan this evening is causing freezing rain along it's leading edge. The precipitation may begin as rain in above zero temperatures but quickly changes over to freezing rain as the front moves through and the temperatures drop. \n\nThe precipitation should turn to snow later this evening and end Sunday by morning.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The snow will persist throughout the night, then taper off from west to east on Sunday. Snowfall amounts will likely end up in the 10 to 20 cm range, with up to 25 cm through the Melfort, Nipawin, and Hudson Bay areas. \n\nFurther south, amounts through tonight and Sunday will be in the 1 to 5 cm range as a cold front swings through, along with a risk of freezing rain or freezing drizzle tonight. Again, the precipitation in southern regions will end from west to east on Sunday.\n\nModerate to strong northeast winds in the areas receiving heavy snow will also give reduced visibilities in blowing snow, especially this evening.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
