Some localized flooding is also possible.\n\n###\n\nStrong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.\n\nFor more information: http://www.emergencymanagementontario.ca/english/beprepared/beprepared.html.<br>Expires: 2019-05-26T06:29:13-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-05-25T22:26:13-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2586501430.2019<br>Area: Simcoe - Delhi - Norfolk, Dunnville - Caledonia - Haldimand, City of Hamilton, St. Catharines - Grimsby - Northern Niagara Region, Niagara Falls - Welland - Southern Niagara Region",

Some localized flooding is also possible.\n\n###\n\nStrong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.\n\nFor more information: http://www.emergencymanagementontario.ca/english/beprepared/beprepared.html.<br>Expires: 2019-05-26T06:29:23-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-05-25T22:12:23-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1958773186.2019<br>Area: Simcoe - Delhi - Norfolk, Dunnville - Caledonia - Haldimand, St. Thomas - Aylmer - Eastern Elgin County, Brantford - County of Brant, City of Toronto, Uxbridge - Beaverton - Northern Durham Region, Newmarket - Georgina - Northern York Region, Pickering - Oshawa - Southern Durham Region, Vaughan - Richmond Hill - Markham, City of Hamilton, Mississauga - Brampton, Halton Hills - Milton, Burlington - Oakville, St. Catharines - Grimsby - Northern Niagara Region, Niagara Falls - Welland - Southern Niagara Region",

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoky Skies Bulletin - May 25, 2019\n\nSeveral regions in BC are being impacted or are likely to be impacted by wildfire smoke over the next 24-48 hours. The next bulletin update will be available May 27,2019.\n\nThe bulletin can be accessed online at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air/air-quality/air-advisories.\n\nBe informed:\nDuring  a  wildfire,  smoke  conditions can  change  quickly  over  short  distances  and  can  vary  considerably hour-by-hour. \n\nWildfire smoke is a natural part of our environment but it is   important to be mindful that exposure to smoke may affect   your health. \n\nPeople with pre-existing health conditions, the elderly, infants, children and sensitive individuals are more likely to   experience health effects from smoke exposure.\n\nFollow your common sense:\n-Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes difficult or you feel unwell.\n-Stay cool and drink plenty of fluids.\n-Carry any rescue medications with you at all times.\n-Make sure that children and others who cannot care for themselves follow the same advice. Monitor your symptoms\n-Different people have different responses to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears.\n-People with asthma or other chronic illness should activate the personal care plans they have designed with their family physicians.\n-If you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC at 8-1-1.\n-If you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your health care provider, walk-in clinic, or emergency department. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1. \n\nTips to reduce your exposure:\n-Smoke levels may be lower indoors but will still be elevated, so stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.\n-Running a commercially available HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter can improve indoor air quality in the room where the device is located.\n-If you have a forced air heating/cooling system in your home, it may help to change the filter and set the fan to run continuously.\n-Reduce indoor air pollution sources such as smoking, burning incense, and frying foods.\n-Consider going to a library, community center, or shopping mall with cooler filtered air to get some relief from the smoke.\n-If travelling in a car with air conditioning, keep the windows up and the ventilation set to recirculate.\n-If you are very sensitive to smoke, consider moving to another location with cleaner air, but be aware that conditions can change rapidly.\n-Maintaining good overall health is a good way to prevent health effects resulting from short-term exposure to air pollution.\n\nMore information:\n-For general information about wildfire smoke and your health, contact HealthLinkBC:\n--Phone 8-1-1 (toll free, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week), or\n--Check the Wildfires and Your Health webpage at: https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-feature/wildfires.\n-The current Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and other air quality information is available at the BC Air Quality website, http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/bcairquality/readings/aqhi-table.xml.\n-Forecasts of smoke levels over the next 48 hours are available from the Environment and Climate Change Canada FireWork prediction system, https://weather.gc.ca/firework/indexe.html.\n-If you need to work outdoors in smoky conditions, material can be found at theWorkSafe  BC  Wildfire  FAQ  website,  https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/information-sheets/wildfire-smoke-frequently-asked-questions-faq.\n-First Nations Health Authority: http://www.fnha.ca/what-we-do/environmental-health/wildfire-information\n\nContact information:\nMedia and public inquiries regarding air quality and this bulletin: Gail Roth, Air Quality Meteorologist, Ministry of Environment & Climate Change Strat-egy, 250-565-4210.\n\nMedia questions regarding health implications of wildfires:\nFirst Nations Health Authority\nEnvironmental Public Health Services or Main FNHA Line: 604-693-6500\nAfter Hours: 1-844-666-0711\nEmail: Ephs.afterhours@fnha.ca\nMedia line: 604-831-4898\n\nNorthern Health Authority\nMedia Line: 1-877-961-7724\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-26T15:22:50-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
