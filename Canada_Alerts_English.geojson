This thunderstorm is moving very quickly northwards at 70 km/h.\n\n###\n\nThis is a dangerous and potentially life-threatening situation. Widespread and extremely strong wind gusts can destroy buildings with tornado-like damage, flatten large stands of trees and blow vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2020-07-24T05:38:54-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-24T03:25:54-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2596285500.2020<br>Area: City of Regina, R.M. of Dufferin including Bethune and Findlater, R.M. of Pense including Pense Belle Plaine and Stony Beach, R.M. of Redburn including Rouleau and Hearne, R.M. of Lumsden including Lumsden Regina Beach and Craven, R.M. of Sherwood including Grand Coulee, R.M. of Bratt's Lake including Wilcox Corinne and Estlin, R.M. of Lajord including Lajord Kronau and Riceton, R.M. of Francis including Vibank Sedley and Odessa, R.M. of Edenwold including Balgonie and Piapot Res., R.M. of South Qu'Appelle including Qu'Appelle and Edgeley, R.M. of Elmsthorpe including Avonlea and Truax, R.M. of Caledonia including Milestone and Parry, R.M. of Scott including Yellowgrass Lang and Lewvan",
