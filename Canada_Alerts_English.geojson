Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nSnow squalls possible tonight into Thursday morning.\n\nLake effect snow is expected through the day with local snowfall accumulations of 2 to 5 cm possible by this evening. \n\nAs colder air moves over Lake Huron late in the afternoon, snow squalls are likely to affect the area beginning this evening. Local snowfall accumulations may reach 10 to 15 cm by Thursday morning in the heaviest snow squalls. Gusty northwest winds will also lead to local blowing snow with these snow squalls\n\nThe snow squalls will begin to weaken Thursday morning, with additional accumulations of 2 to 4 cm possible by Thursday afternoon.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Local snowfall accumulations may reach 15 cm by Thursday morning in the heaviest snow squalls. Gusty northwest winds will also lead to local blowing snow with these snow squalls\n\nThe snow squalls will begin to weaken Thursday morning, with additional accumulations of 5 cm possible by Thursday afternoon.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather.
