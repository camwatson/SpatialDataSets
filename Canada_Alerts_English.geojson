The precipitation will begin as freezing rain and change to freezing drizzle or drizzle Sunday afternoon. \n\nSeveral millimeters of ice accretion are possible over these regions with some areas possibly receiving up to 5 cm of snow and ice pellets in addition to the freezing rain.\n\nStrong wind gusts up to 70 km/h coupled with ice accretion on tree branches and power lines could cause power outages.\n\nThis wintry weather is associated with a Colorado Low that will track over Southern Ontario on Sunday.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and hazardous.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Several hours of freezing rain expected on Sunday.\n\nPrecipitation is expected to move into the area late tonight or early Sunday morning.  The precipitation will begin as freezing rain and change to freezing drizzle or drizzle early Sunday afternoon. For areas closer to the lake shore the transition from freezing rain to drizzle will occur late Sunday morning.\n\nSeveral millimeters of ice accretion are possible over these regions with some areas possibly receiving a few centimeters of snow and ice pellets in addition to the freezing rain.\n\nStrong wind gusts up to 70 km/h coupled with ice accretion on tree branches and power lines could cause power outages.\n\nThis wintry weather is associated with a Colorado Low that will track over Southern Ontario on Sunday.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Ice build-up may cause tree branches to break.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
