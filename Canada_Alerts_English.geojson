During air quality advisories, this bylaw also prohibits recreational fires, use of wood-burning appliances (except for sole wood burning heat users), and street sweeping activities (unless approved by an Authorized Person). Industry is required to follow permit requirements that are triggered during air quality advisories and are asked to reduce emissions wherever possible.\n\n###\n\nPeople with cardiovascular disease can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate the disease leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-01-15T10:14:27-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

				"Summary" : "Description: More snow for the south coast this week...\n\nOutflow winds through mainland coastal inlets and valleys will continue to drive cold arctic air into the Georgia Basin through much of the week. Additionally over the next few days, a series of pacific disturbances will combine with the cold airmass to produce several rounds of snow. \n\nEarly this morning, an initial weak system will produce some flurries near the Straight of Georgia and the Juan de Fuca Strait.  Converging winds at low levels could produce local accumulations of a few cm's.\n\nA second more organized system will move in tonight and take aim at extreme southern Vancouver Island. Snowfall warnings have been issued for Greater Victoria, The Malahat, Gulf Islands, southern inland Vancouver Island (Lake Cowichan),  East Vancouver Island from Duncan to Nanaimo, and for Port Renfrew on west Vancouver Island. 10 to 15 cm of accumulation is expected by Wednesday morning. Heavy snow from this system will likely move up the Island to Parksville-Qualicum and Courtney-Comox during the day Wednesday.   \n\nThe Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley will also see snow tonight with amounts of 5 to 10 cm expected by Wednesday morning and an additional few cm's during the day Wednesday.  \n\nA third system, associated with a deep offshore low, is on the horizon for Wednesday night. A fair degree of  uncertainty exists regarding its impact upon the south coast. The mainland coast may suffer a glancing blow however Vancouver Island may see a considerable amount of snow as outflow winds increase with the passage of this system.\n\nPlease refer to your local public forecast for details on snowfall amounts.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Heavy snowfall and strong winds possible beginning on Thursday.\n\nTotal snowfall: 10 to 15 cm or possibly higher for some regions.\n\nMaximum wind gusts: 70 km/h.  Possibly higher for Cape Breton.\n\nLocations: Nova Scotia.\n\nTime span: Thursday morning  into Friday.\n\nStorm surge: higher than normal water levels over the southeastern Gulf of St. Lawrence and Cape Breton Island.\n\nRemarks: An intensifying low pressure system approaching from New England will move to lie near southwestern Nova Scotia on Thursday and will skirt the Atlantic Coast before heading away on Friday. This will give snowfall to most of the province. Current guidance suggest the highest amounts may be over western mainland Nova Scotia. Winds may reach or exceed warning criteria over eastern mainland regions and Cape Breton Island Thursday night into Friday.\n\nHigh waves and storm surge may affect the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence and Cape Breton Island on Thursday night into Friday. This may cause some coastal flooding and overwash on north to northeast facing shorelines of the eastern mainland and Cape Breton during the high tides Thursday night and Friday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: More snow for the south coast this week...\n\nOutflow winds through mainland coastal inlets and valleys will continue to drive cold arctic air into the Georgia Basin through much of the week. Additionally over the next few days, a series of pacific disturbances will combine with the cold airmass to produce several rounds of snow. \n\nEarly this morning, an initial weak system will produce some flurries near the Straight of Georgia and the Juan de Fuca Strait.  Converging winds at low levels could produce local accumulations of a few cm's.\n\nA second more organized system will move in tonight and take aim at extreme southern Vancouver Island. Snowfall warnings have been issued for Greater Victoria, The Malahat, Gulf Islands, southern inland Vancouver Island (Lake Cowichan),  East Vancouver Island from Duncan to Nanaimo, and for Port Renfrew on west Vancouver Island. 10 to 15 cm of accumulation is expected by Wednesday morning. Heavy snow from this system will likely move up the Island to Parksville-Qualicum and Courtney-Comox during the day Wednesday.   \n\nThe Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley will also see snow tonight with amounts of 5 to 10 cm expected by Wednesday morning and an additional few cm's during the day Wednesday.  \n\nA third system, associated with a deep offshore low, is on the horizon for Wednesday night. A fair degree of  uncertainty exists regarding its impact upon the south coast. The mainland coast may suffer a glancing blow however Vancouver Island may see a considerable amount of snow as outflow winds increase with the passage of this system.\n\nPlease refer to your local public forecast for details on snowfall amounts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
