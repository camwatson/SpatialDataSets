				"Summary" : "Description: Potential snow for the BC South Coast tonight and Friday\n\nA low tracking south along the BC coast will spread moisture across the BC South Coast beginning overnight tonight. With temperatures hovering near the freezing mark, a mix of rain or snow is forecast across the region. \n\nAs is frequently the case, snowfall amounts will vary with elevation and proximity to the ocean. Computer guidance continues to suggests that the Fraser Valley, Howe Sound, and higher elevations of Metro Vancouver and Vancouver Island have the potential for snowfall accumulations to exceed 5 cm through Friday morning. The snow is expected to change to rain near midday Friday. \n\nThis storm will also bring strong southeasterly winds to regions near the Strait of Georgia.\n\nMore snow is possible this weekend as a series of weather systems embedded in a cool northwest flow from the Gulf of Alaska moves ashore. \n\nEarly next week, very cold arctic air from the BC Interior will arrive on the South Coast.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
