				"Summary" : "Description: Rain, snow and strong winds to end the week.\n\nAn intense low pressure system will affect the whole province on Friday and on Saturday.   Regions in a line from the Temiscamingue region to the Eastern Townships and Beauce could see 15 to 25 millimetres of rain and strong winds.\n\nFurther north and east, significant snowfall amounts are expected.   Strong winds combined with this snow will greatly reduce visibilities in the blowing snow over some areas.\n\nFor now, there is still some uncertainty as to the low pressure system's exact track. The types and amounts of precipitation will depend on this track.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
