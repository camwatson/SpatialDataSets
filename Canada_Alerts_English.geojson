				"Summary" : "Description: Moist easterly flow associated with a deep Alberta low will continue to stream moisture across the Rocky Mountains and into B.C. today. \n\nMost of these regions have already received significant amounts of rain over the past 24 hours, ranging from 15 to 30 mm, with higher amounts over the mountains, locally up to 30-50 mm. \n\nAs the main band of organized rainfall slides further North, rain will end rapidly this morning across the Cariboo but persist along an axis extending from Williston to Prince George to Blue River. However, the unstable airmass over regions to the south will favour the development of showers and thunderstorms later in the day. Some heavier showers and thunderstorms will have the potential of adding 10-15 mm locally over short periods well into this evening.\n\nHigher rainfall amounts are expected over the mountains, especially over the Williston, McGregor, and Cariboo regions where storm totals will reach 40 to 60 mm.-\n\nAlthough the rainfall amounts may not be exceptionally heavy, the significance of this event is due to the potential for rising rivers levels. There is significant concern for high flows in the Quesnel River (Cariboo Mountains), the North Thompson (Blue River/Clearwater region), and South Thompson (Shuswap).\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Manitoba Infrastructure‚Äôs Hydrologic Forecast Centre has issued a Flood Warning for southwestern, western and central regions of Manitoba. A weather system may release 80 to 150 millimetres of rain in these areas in between June 29 to July 1. Areas in southwest Manitoba, including Virden and Brandon could see up to 175 millimetres of rain during this time.\n\nIf you are in the affected area, please continue to be watchful as local waterways are expected to rise quickly and may cause flooding. There is a potential for overland flooding in low lying areas. Do not attempt to cross fast flowing waters or waters of unknown depth. Use caution when driving on all roads as road conditions may have changed. Avoid flooded areas. Follow all directions by local authorities, listen for updates and take all necessary precautions to stay safe. Stay tuned to local media for updates.<br>Expires: 2020-07-02T13:00:00-05:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Manitoba Emergency Measures Organization, 2020-07-02T12:15:00-05:00, 180C1E41-2491-E1C9-5848-B3CBD8BD960A<br>Area: Southwestern, Western and Central Manitoba",

				"Summary" : "Description: A long episode of rain, at times heavy, is expected.\n\nA further 20 to 30 mm of rain is expected to fall through this afternoon\nover the Peace River and Fort Nelson regions.\n\nThe heavy rain is being caused by low pressure centre over central Alberta drifting northwards today. Strong and moist easterly flow associated with the low is generating enhanced precipitation as the flow encounters the eastern slopes of the Rockies. Over the Muncho Lake Park-Stone Mountain Park region the most significant rainfall will be in the Tetsa River region.\n\nThe low will weaken somewhat and stall near the AB-BC border this afternoon. The character of the precipitation will become more showery with widespread thunderstorms developing this afternoon over northeastern BC that will persist throughout the evening and into the overnight period. These storms will cause local downpours that will contribute to storm rainfall totals.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Strong and moist easterly flow associated with the low is generating enhanced precipitation as the flow encounters the eastern slopes of the Rockies. Over the Muncho Lake Park-Stone Mountain Park region the most significant rainfall will be in the Tetsa River region.\n\nThe low will weaken somewhat and stall near the AB-BC border this afternoon. The character of the precipitation will become more showery with widespread thunderstorms developing this afternoon over northeastern BC that will persist throughout the evening and into the overnight period. These storms will cause local downpours that will contribute to storm rainfall totals.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
