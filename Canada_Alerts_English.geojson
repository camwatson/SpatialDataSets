This airmass will first move across the central interior today and then across the south on Sunday. \n\nTemperatures will plummet to values not seen in years. With strong north winds, it is expected that wind chill values will reach between minus 30 and minus 40 through the central interior by Sunday morning and down to minus 30 in the Columbias and southwest interior by Monday morning. Most of the Kootenays won't reach really cold wind chill values until Monday night.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
