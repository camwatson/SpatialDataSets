The front will move northward on Thursday as a low pressure system approaches. Another brief period of heavy rain will potentially occur Thursday night as the low moves inland.\n\nSo far, at Bella Coola near 70 mm of rain has fallen and near 100 mm has fallen over some coastal areas. Rain, at times heavy, will continue through Thursday morning. Total rainfall amounts for the system will likely reach near 250 mm over the coast and about 150 mm inland.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.
