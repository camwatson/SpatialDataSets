The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Island Health has issued an Air Quality Advisory for Port Alberni because of high concentrations of fine particulate matter that are expected to persist until weather conditions change. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Staying indoors and in air conditioned spaces helps to reduce fine particulate exposure. Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women and infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease. \n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-02-11T09:15:39-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada‚Äôs website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Minist√®re de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montr√©al, visit the R√©seau de surveillance de la qualit√© de l‚Äôair de la Ville de Montr√©al‚Äôs website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Qu√©bec, visit the Minist√®re de la Sant√© et des Services sociaux‚Äôs website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.
