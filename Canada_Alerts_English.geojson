Snow is expected to persist through Thursday and likely Friday as well, with significant accumulations possible. \n\nAt this time, it looks as if conditions will begin to improve for most areas by Saturday but accumulating snow is possible through the remainder of the weekend.  Further details will be provided in subsequent messages, as it is too soon to accurately forecast amounts and duration of precipitation due to uncertainty.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
