The snow may fall heavily at times, particularly overnight and early Wednesday morning.  Total snowfall accumulations near 15 centimetres are expected. A few locations may receive in excess of 20 centimetres by Wednesday evening due to lake effect snow bands from lake Superior Wednesday afternoon into the evening. \n\nSnow squall warnings may be issued after the main snowfall event due to snow bands that will likely become isolated by Wednesday evening.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
