Precipitation will begin as a mix of rain showers and flurries in the southwest, and may briefly become mixed with rain or ice pellets during the afternoon along parts of the South Shore. The snow will taper off to flurries late in the day but may still make for a messy afternoon commute. Temperatures will then drop rapidly overnight into Friday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Winds will gradually ease and visibilities will improve Thursday morning as the low moves eastward and weakens.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
