Northeasterly winds of 60 gusting to 90 km/h will persist for much of tonight before moderating slightly but remaining strong on Wednesday. The system will continue to weaken on Thursday with winds gradually diminishing into the 30 gusting to 50 km/h range by Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn addition to the strong winds, wet snow and blowing snow will accompany this system. With surface temperatures hovering around the zero mark snowfall amounts will be difficult to predict as some of the precipitation will melt with ground contact. At this time total snowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm are expected for today, tonight and Wednesday.\n\n###\n\nDamage to buildings, such as to roof shingles and windows, may occur.
