Over the southern edge of the Southwestern Grand Banks and the southern edge of the Southeastern Grand Banks, hurricane force winds will likely occur. Waves over the southeastern offshore waters are expected to be generally 6 to 9 metres except over the southern edges of the southern Grand Banks where waves of 9 to 12 metres are expected.\n\nThe Canadian Hurricane Centre will provide another update on Epsilon by 9:30 PM NDT Saturday.\n\n\nForecaster(s): Hatt/Couturier\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-10-25T05:35:13-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-10-23T23:36:13-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0679770575.2020<br>Area: Avalon Peninsula Southeast",
