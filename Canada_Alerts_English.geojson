Temperatures in the minus thirties along with winds of 10 to 15 km/h will produce extreme cold windchills of minus 40 or colder. Temperatures are expected to moderate slightly through the day today. However, extreme cold will return for a third night to some areas tonight and Tuesday.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nFor more information on cold and your health, visit Manitoba Health at https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/cold.html or call Health Links - Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Temperatures in the minus thirties along with winds of 10 to 15 km/h will produce extreme cold windchills of minus 40 or colder. Temperatures are expected to moderate slightly through the day today. However, extreme cold will return for a third night to some areas tonight and Tuesday.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
