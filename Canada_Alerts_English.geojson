Light northerly winds have resulted in the smoke plumes affecting areas to the south and southeast of these fires. Wind will become light westerly tonight which may direct smoke plumes to the east. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\nThese smoke plumes will continue to affect the region into Sunday. \n\nIf you, or someone in your care, develop symptoms, reduce or reschedule strenuous outdoors activities where ever possible until the air quality improves.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-07T17:20:44-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-07T01:21:44-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0401577219.2019<br>Area: Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake, Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell, Summer Beaver - Wunnummin Lake - Kingfisher Lake, Pickle Lake - Cat Lake, Red Lake - Woodland Caribou Park, Ear Falls - Perrault Falls - Western Lac Seul, Savant Lake - Sturgeon Lake, Sioux Lookout - Eastern Lac Seul, Kenora - Grassy Narrows - Whitedog, Sioux Narrows - Nestor Falls - Morson, Dryden - Vermilion Bay, Ignace - English River, Fort Frances - Emo - Rainy River, Seine River Village - Mine Centre",

Some of the thunderstorms will contain very heavy downpours which could give 20 to 40 mm or rain in an hour or less.\n\nIn addition, frequent lightning and a few wind gusts near 60 km/h are possible during a thunderstorm.\n\nThe precipitation amounts will be quite variable across the region, with some areas getting little or no rain at all. \n\nThe shower and thunderstorm activity will be pushed to the southeast of the area later this evening as the cold front works its way south of the international border.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, damaging hail and torrential rain.\n\nFavourable conditions for thunderstorm development are present over southeastern Saskatchewan this afternoon. Some of these thunderstorms may become severe.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2019-07-07T03:03:02-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-07T01:09:02-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0600168409.2019<br>Area: Kneehill Co. near Carbon, Wheatland Co. near Rockyford and Rosebud, Wheatland Co. near Strathmore Lyalta and Carseland, Wheatland Co. near Standard and Gleichen, Siksika Res. 146, Vulcan Co. near Arrowwood Herronton and Queenstown, Vulcan Co. near Vulcan and Ensign",
