				"Summary" : "Description: A snow squall watch is in effect tonight as conditions are favourable for the development of snow bands which could produce zero visibilities.\n\nA significant drop in temperatures is then expected, which could potentially make some roads icy and slippery.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
