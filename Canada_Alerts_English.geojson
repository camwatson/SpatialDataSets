				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions will be favourable for the development of funnel clouds today.\n\n\n###\n\nThese types of funnel clouds are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nIf conditions become more favourable for the development of landspout tornadoes, watches and warnings will be issued by Environment Canada.\n\nLandspout tornadoes do not usually cause significant damage but can still be dangerous. They can be strong enough to topple trees, damage roofs or toss debris short distances.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from forest fires over eastern Manitoba and northwestern Ontario continues to linger over eastern portions of the province. Southerly winds have however redirected the smoke away from the western Red River valley and Winnipeg and brought an improvement in air quality to these regions. \n\nThe air quality is expected to improve this evening and overnight over southeastern Manitoba as the southerly winds continue to push the smoke to the north. Communities closer to the fires and Ontario border, such as Little Grand Rapids and Bissett, may still experience poor air quality through tonight and into Monday.\n\nThese same winds will begin to push the smoke into northeastern Manitoba tonight. This smoke will linger through the day Monday and likely into Monday night.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nDue to the smoky conditions, individuals living in or travelling to the above noted areas are advised to be aware of potential health concerns that can be associated with current air conditions. In these current conditions, even healthy individuals may experience sore eyes, tears, coughing and a runny nose.\n\nIn areas affected by smoke from wildland fires, Manitobans are encouraged to:\n- limit outdoor activity and/or strenuous physical activity; if breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce the activity\n- reduce exposure to smoke by staying indoors or moving to areas with cleaner air, as conditions can vary dramatically by area\n- turn off furnaces and air-conditioning units that may draw smoke indoors\n- keep indoor air cleaner by avoiding smoking or burning other materials \n\nPeople at higher risk include young children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with heart or lung conditions (particularly asthma), and therefore should avoid as much exposure to smoke as possible.\n\nManitobans with health questions or concerns can contact their health-care provider or call Health Links – Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257. More information on the health effects of smoke is available at www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/smoke.html.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-08T13:52:05-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Manitoba Health, 2019-07-07T21:53:05-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3546721591.2019<br>Area: R.M. of St. Clements incl.
