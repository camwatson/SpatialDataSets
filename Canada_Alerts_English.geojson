The combination of these winds and the fact that we are currently in a period of mid-amplitude tidal ranges may produce minor breaking sea conditions along the coast near the following localities on the dates and at the times specified (Eastern Standard Time).\n\n\nKamouraska - Rivière-du-Loup - Trois-Pistoles: 2021-02-03, from 04:30 AM to 08:30 AM.\n\nRimouski - Mont-Joli: 2021-02-03, from 04:00 AM to 08:00 AM.\n\nMatane: 2021-02-03, from 04:00 AM to 08:00 AM.\n\nSainte-Anne-des-Monts - Grande-Vallée: 2021-02-03, from 04:00 AM to 08:00 AM.\n\nForillon Park - Gaspé - Percé: 2021-02-03, from 04:00 AM to 08:00 AM.\n\nNew-Carlisle - Chandler: 2021-02-03, from 04:30 AM to 08:30 AM.\n\nLes Escoumins - Forestville: 2021-02-03, from 04:00 AM to 08:00 AM.\n\nBaie-Comeau: 2021-02-03, from 04:00 AM to 08:00 AM.\n\nSept-Îles - Port-Cartier: 2021-02-03, from 3:30 AM to 07:30 AM.\n\n###\n\nCoastal erosion is possible in vulnerable areas.\n\nStorm surge warnings are issued when water levels pose a threat to coastal regions.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
