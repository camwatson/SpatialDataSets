However, for areas inland and over higher terrain, air temperatures will be cooler so snowfall accumulations could reach 15 cm and visibilities may be reduced in blowing snow.

The rain/snow boundary will likely be across central New Brunswick. Rainfall amounts of 15 to 30 millimetres are possible over southern sections with 5 to 10 centimetres of snow possible for the northern and central areas of the province by Friday morning.\n\nAs colder air moves into the province from the north on Friday, flurries or periods of snow are forecast give an additional 5 to 10 centimetres of snow to central and eastern areas of the province. Reduction to visibility could create potentially hazardous driving conditions Friday afternoon and evening.  \n\nSaturday will be mainly sunny but remain cold across the province as temperatures will struggle to reach the freezing mark in many areas.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Colder air will move in behind this system later on Friday and persist on Saturday. As this colder air arrives from the northwest, showers will turn to periods of snow late Friday afternoon or Friday evening which could give local accumulations and potentially hazardous driving conditions, especially to the Annapolis Valley, northern Nova Scotia and parts of Cape Breton Island. \n\nSaturday will be a cold and blustery day across the entire province with onshore flurries and temperatures struggling to climb above zero in some areas.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
