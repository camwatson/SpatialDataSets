				"Summary" : "Description: An intense low pressure system will develop over the Eastern U.S. Seaboard on Saturday. It will affect Central Quebec beginning Saturday evening, then reach Eastern Quebec on Sunday.\n\nThis storm may bring significant snowfall amounts, strong winds, widespread blowing snow, and even freezing rain.\nAlthough it is still too early to forecast with certainty how much snow will fall and what areas will be hardest hit, the Lower St. Lawrence and the Gaspé Peninsula could see up to 30 centimetres of snow.\n\nFreezing rain should mainly affect the Eastern Gaspé Peninsula.\n\nThese poor weather conditions may have a significant impact on travel. Be prepared for changing road conditions that could deteriorate rapidly in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nFuture weather statements will provide more details as the low pressure system's track as well as precipitation types and amounts become more certain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
