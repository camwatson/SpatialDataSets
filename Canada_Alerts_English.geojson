On Friday night, the precipitation will intensify. Generally snow is expected inland while coastal areas of southeastern Labrador may see some mixing with rain. It is too soon to accurately predict snowfall totals but at this time, it appears the heaviest accumulations will occur north of the Straits area.\n\nA snowfall warning has been issued for Postville to Makkovik for a separate system currently affecting the area.\n\nPeak wind gusts: Possibly 90 to 120 km/h.\n\nTime span: Saturday morning to Sunday morning.\n\nRemarks: Winds will strengthen out of the northeast on Friday night and potentially reach warning criteria by early Saturday. Strong wind gusts will continue and gradually shift to northwesterly by Saturday night.  Coastal areas will have the greatest chance of seeing the strongest wind gusts.
