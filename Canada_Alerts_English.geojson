				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms this afternoon and this evening over much of southern Manitoba.\n\nA warm and humid airmass is in place over the region and a cold front is approaching from the west. As the cold front lifts the warm humid airmass, thunderstorms will develop. Some of these thunderstorms will have the potential to become severe with hail to the size of golf balls and damaging winds in excess of 90 km/h the most likely threats. In addition, storms will be very moisture-laden so excessive rainfall is possible.\n\n###\n\nRapidly rising rivers and creeks can sweep away bridges, culverts, buildings, and people. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-06T07:09:10-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-05T21:20:10-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2741562589.2020<br>Area: City of Winnipeg, R.M. of Coldwell incl.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions continue to be favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms this evening over much of southern Manitoba.\n\nA warm and humid airmass is in place over the region and a cold front currently over southeastern Manitoba is tracking westward. Through the day, thunderstorms have developed along this cold front and some storms have become severe. As the cold front continues it track westward, the severe thunderstorm potential still exists with the potential of hail to the size of golf balls and damaging winds in excess of 90 km/h the most likely threats. In addition, storms will be very moisture-laden so excessive rainfall is possible.\n\n###\n\nRapidly rising rivers and creeks can sweep away bridges, culverts, buildings, and people. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-06T07:09:02-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-05T22:17:02-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3429770205.2020<br>Area: R.M. of St. Clements incl.
