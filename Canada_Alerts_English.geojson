The snow will enter the Red River Valley this evening, reaching the Winnipeg area between 6 and 8 pm and taper off overnight.\n\nThe cold front will usher in a period of frigid temperatures that will persist well into next week.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
