The heaviest snowfall accumulation is expected in an area that includes Kincardine, Ripley, Lucknow, Wingham, and Gorrie. \n\nWhen: \nNow through tonight. The worst period of blowing snow is expected now through midnight. The period of heaviest snowfall is expected this evening. \n\nDiscussion: \nSnow squalls will continue through tonight off Lake Huron. Widespread blowing snow and blizzard-like conditions is the biggest concern this afternoon and evening. Some areas may see heavy snowfall accumulation as well.\nWhiteouts and dangerous travel conditions have been reported across the area this afternoon.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Road closures are possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls and dangerous whiteout conditions today and tonight. This is a dangerous situation! \n\nWhat: \nWhiteouts due to blowing snow. \nTotal snow amounts of 10 to 20 cm locally; 10 cm today, 10 cm tonight.\n\nWhere: \nBlowing snow will be most hazardous in open areas, such as along open fields. \n\nWhen: \nNow through tonight. The worst period of blowing snow is expected now through midnight. \n\nDiscussion: \nSnow squalls will continue through tonight off Lake Huron and Georgian Bay. Widespread blowing snow and blizzard-like conditions is the biggest concern this afternoon and evening. Some areas may see heavy snowfall accumulation as well. \nWhiteouts and dangerous travel conditions have been reported across the area this afternoon.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Road closures are possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2021-03-02T11:03:10-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2021-03-01T19:04:10-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3914476317.2021<br>Area: Bruce Peninsula - Sauble Beach - Tobermory, Owen Sound - Blue Mountains - Northern Grey County, Hanover - Dundalk - Southern Grey County, Shelburne - Mansfield - Northern Dufferin County",
