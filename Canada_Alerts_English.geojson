Snow will change briefly to rain over southern New Brunswick.\n\nTotal snowfall: 10 to 25 cm. Locally higher amounts possible.\n\nTotal rainfall: 2 to 10 mm.\n\nLocations: All of New Brunswick for snow, southern New Brunswick for rain.\n\nTime span: Tuesday morning into Wednesday morning, potentially persisting into Wednesday afternoon over northern New Brunswick.\n\nRemarks: A disturbance is expected to develop near Cape Cod early on New Year's Eve and track slowly northeastward across New Brunswick on New Year's Day. Snow is expected to develop Tuesday morning ahead of this system and spread to all of the province by late Tuesday afternoon. Snow will gradually change to possibly a brief period of freezing rain or ice pellets and then to rain over southern and eastern New Brunswick Tuesday night into Wednesday morning, but should persist as snow over northwestern sections well into Wednesday.\n\nThe timing and combination of mixed precipitation could impact travel across much of the province on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
