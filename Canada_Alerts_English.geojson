				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls possible beginning late tonight into Saturday morning.\n\nAs winds shift to a more westerly direction late tonight, snow squalls over Lake Huron may shift southward into the area. Strong westerly winds gusting up to 60 km/h will accompany these snow squalls at times.\n\nThus, locally heavy snow and reduced visibilities in blowing snow will be possible for a few hours tonight and Saturday morning if the snow squalls do move south of the Bruce Peninsula.  \n\nLocal snowfall amounts in excess of 15 cm will be possible.\n\nMotorists should consider changing their travel plans accordingly.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

These snow squalls are then expected to continue into tonight and possibly last until Saturday morning.\n\nLocal snowfall amounts near 15 cm are expected. However, if the strongest snow squall from Lake Erie is able to lock in and become stationary for a few hours, snowfall amounts of up to 25 cm are possible.\n\nGiven the strong southwesterly winds gusting up to 80 km/h, areas of near zero visibility in blowing snow and heavy snow will be a concern. Motorists should consider changing travel plans accordingly.\n\n###\n\nVisibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.
