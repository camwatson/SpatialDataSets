Total snowfall amounts of 15 to 25 cm are possible. The heaviest snowfall is most likely from Thursday afternoon until Friday morning.\n\nTravel conditions along Highway 17 between Nipigon and Wawa will likely become hazardous due to accumulating snow and very low visibility. Motorists should consider changing travel plans accordingly. \n\nSnowfall warnings may be issued as this event draws closer.\n\nAt this point, it appears that the town of Wawa may receive lesser amounts than areas farther west.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The snow will enter the Red River Valley this evening, reaching the Winnipeg area between 6 and 8 pm and taper off overnight.\n\nThe cold front will usher in a period of frigid temperatures that will persist well into next week.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Visibilities will be rapidly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow.\n\nLocal snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 centimeters are forecast to fall tonight under this band of snow.\n\nThe band of snow currently stretches from Portage la Prairie southwards to the U.S. border and northwards to the central Interlake.  The snow will enter the Red River Valley this evening, reaching the Winnipeg area between 6 and 8 pm and taper off overnight.\n\nThe cold front will usher in a period of frigid temperatures that will persist well into next week.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
