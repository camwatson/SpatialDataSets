				"Summary" : "Description: An approaching Pacific storm system has the potential to give winter storm conditions to Kitimat and Stewart this weekend.\n\nThe storm system will bring an influx of moisture to the region while also increasing the draw of cold air from the interior outflowing through the inlets and valleys.  This combination has the potential to give significant snowfall accumulations to Kitimat and moderate snowfall amounts to Terrace.  The stronger outflow winds and fresh snow will result in near zero visibilities in blowing snow and extreme wind chill values.\n\nThe effects of this system will begin near midnight on Friday night and persist through the weekend.  For Terrace, wind and snowfall will begin to taper off on Sunday afternoon.  In Kitimat, the winds will also diminish on Sunday afternoon, however significant snowfall will continue into Monday morning.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Winter Storm conditions possible overnight tonight and Saturday.\n\nAn approaching Pacific storm will bring a mixture of snow, freezing rain, and rain to the south coast beginning tonight and continuing Saturday. Strong winds will also accompany the storm. \n\nThe storm will arrive tonight with heavy snow beginning late this evening across the south coast. As warmer air associated with storm penetrates the region, the snow will begin to transition to rain. Timing this transition to rain is always challenging in these situations. There is a chance that this transition could be delayed resulting in higher snowfall amounts. It is also possible this transition will include a period of freezing rain.\n\nIn addition to heavy snow, freezing rain is also a significant threat from this storm. Over Fraser Valley, Howe Sound, and Whistler, temperatures near surface will likely remain slightly below zero due to cold outflow winds pouring out from the BC interior. This sets up ideal conditions for freezing rain as the warmer air overrides cold air trapped at the surface. \n\nAs a result as we move through late tonight and into Saturday, expect the snow to change or become mixed with freezing rain over these locations. It is uncertain how long this freezing rain could last as we transition to warmer temperatures rising above zero. \n\nStay tuned to the latest Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest warnings and forecasts.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Poor weather conditions may contribute to transportation delays.\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nWinter storm watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Total snowfall amounts of 15 to 20 cm are expected. Strong winds gusting up to 60 km/h will create areas of local blowing snow. A brief period of rain is possible late Saturday. The snow or rain will ease to flurries overnight Saturday night. \n\nIn addition, lake effect snow is also expected to begin behind this system, which will create more snow for areas near Lake Huron and Georgian Bay.\n\nVisibilities will be reduced in areas of blowing snow, which can make travel hazardous.

				"Summary" : "Description: Winter Storm conditions possible overnight tonight and Saturday.\n\nAn approaching Pacific storm will bring a mixture of snow, freezing rain, and rain to the south coast beginning tonight and continuing Saturday. Strong winds will also accompany the storm. \n\nThe storm will arrive tonight with heavy snow beginning late this evening across the south coast. As warmer air associated with storm penetrates the region, the snow will begin to transition to rain. Timing this transition to rain is always challenging in these situations. There is a chance that this transition could be delayed resulting in higher snowfall amounts. It is also possible this transition will include a period of freezing rain.\n\nIn addition to heavy snow, freezing rain is also a significant threat from this storm. Over Fraser Valley, Howe Sound, and Whistler, temperatures near surface will likely remain slightly below zero due to cold outflow winds pouring out from the BC interior. This sets up ideal conditions for freezing rain as the warmer air overrides cold air trapped at the surface. \n\nAs a result as we move through late tonight and into Saturday, expect the snow to change or become mixed with freezing rain over these locations. It is uncertain how long this freezing rain could last as we transition to warmer temperatures rising above zero. \n\nStay tuned to the latest Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest warnings and forecasts.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Poor weather conditions may contribute to transportation delays.\n\nWinter storm watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A strong weather disturbance will bring highly variable weather conditions to southern Manitoba Friday through Saturday.\n\nA large change in the weather is on the way for southern Manitoba. Snow will begin spreading into the province from the south today, intensifying this evening and through the night. The highest snowfall accumulations on will occur over the Red River Valley, southern Interlake, and areas eastwards. General accumulations of 10 to 20 cm are forecast by the time the snow tapers off on Saturday, however localized areas of slightly higher amounts may occur. \n\nThrough the night, moderate northwesterly winds will develop, combining with the falling snow to produce areas of reduced visibility in blowing snow. The areas most impacted by blowing snow on Friday night will most likely be southwestern Manitoba into the western Red River Valley.\n\nOn Saturday, light snow will continue through the day across much of southern Manitoba with a further accumulation of 1 to 3 cm. The northwesterly winds will strengthen to 40 gusting 70 km/h with temperatures hovering in the low minus teens to -20°C range. The accumulated snow, continuing light snow, and strong winds will produce widespread blowing snow through the day. Winds will gradually ease on Saturday night with improving conditions.\n\nWarnings are in place for several regions in southern Manitoba, but may need to be adjusted as the system approaches. Please stay alert for updated bulletins. Anybody who has plans to travel on area highways Friday night or Saturday should ensure that they check local weather forecasts (https://weather.gc.ca/forecast/canada/index_e.html?id=mb) regional highway conditions (https://manitoba511.ca/en/) before travelling. Ensure that your vehicle contains a winter emergency kit (https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/sfttps/tp201012-en.aspx) in case poor travelling conditions cause you to be stranded for a period of time. Poor travelling conditions will also develop through the Dakotas and Minnesota, where this system will bring higher snowfall accumulations alongside strong(er) winds.\n\nTemperatures will remain below-seasonal through the remainder of the weekend, but a milder weather pattern is likely to develop next week.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A strong weather disturbance will bring highly variable weather conditions to southern Manitoba Friday through Saturday.\n\nA large change in the weather is on the way for southern Manitoba. Snow will begin spreading into the province from the south today, intensifying this evening and through the night. The highest snowfall accumulations on will occur over the Red River Valley, southern Interlake, and areas eastwards. General accumulations of 10 to 20 cm are forecast by the time the snow tapers off on Saturday, however localized areas of slightly higher amounts may occur. \n\nThrough the night, moderate northwesterly winds will develop, combining with the falling snow to produce areas of reduced visibility in blowing snow. The areas most impacted by blowing snow on Friday night will most likely be southwestern Manitoba into the western Red River Valley.\n\nOn Saturday, light snow will continue through the day across much of southern Manitoba with a further accumulation of 1 to 3 cm. The northwesterly winds will strengthen to 40 gusting 70 km/h with temperatures hovering in the low minus teens to -20°C range. The accumulated snow, continuing light snow, and strong winds will produce widespread blowing snow through the day. Winds will gradually ease on Saturday night with improving conditions.\n\nWarnings are in place for several regions in southern Manitoba, but may need to be adjusted as the system approaches. Please stay alert for updated bulletins. Anybody who has plans to travel on area highways Friday night or Saturday should ensure that they check local weather forecasts (https://weather.gc.ca/forecast/canada/index_e.html?id=mb) regional highway conditions (https://manitoba511.ca/en/) before travelling. Ensure that your vehicle contains a winter emergency kit (https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/sfttps/tp201012-en.aspx) in case poor travelling conditions cause you to be stranded for a period of time. Poor travelling conditions will also develop through the Dakotas and Minnesota, where this system will bring higher snowfall accumulations alongside strong(er) winds.\n\nTemperatures will remain below-seasonal through the remainder of the weekend, but a milder weather pattern is likely to develop next week.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
