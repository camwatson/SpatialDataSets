The end time is uncertain at this point.\n\nDetails for Wednesday: Snow, ice pellets, freezing rain, and rain will affect southeastern Labrador and the Upper Lake Melville area. Snowfall amounts will range from 10 to 20 cm inland by Thursday morning, with rainfall amounts of 10 to 20 mm along the coast.  A significant area of freezing rain is likely to occur inland as well.\n\nDetails for Thursday to Sunday:  All above mentioned forms of precipitation will continue through Thursday and likely Friday as well, with significant amounts of each.  At this time, it looks as if conditions will begin to improve in some areas on Saturday, but may continue in other areas into Sunday.  Further details will be provided in subsequent messages, as it is too soon to accurately forecast amounts and duration of precipitation due to uncertainty.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

At this time, it looks as if conditions will begin to improve on Saturday.
