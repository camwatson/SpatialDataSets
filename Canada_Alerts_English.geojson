Local snowfall amounts of 15 to 20 cm in 12 hours are likely.\n\nSnow squalls will taper off  early Wednesday morning.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.

Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nLake effect snow squall bands are coming onshore between Grand Bend and Kincardine and are expected to intensify later this afternoon and evening.\n\nThe snow squalls will continue through the day and into tonight. Local snowfall amounts of 15 to 20 cm in 12 hours are likely.\n\nSnow squalls will taper off  early Wednesday morning.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Rapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: An intense low pressure system tracking northeast over Hudson Strait is giving strong north winds and blowing snow to Coral Harbour. \n\nNorth to northwest winds as high as 60 gusting 80 km/h are likely causing pockets of significantly reduced visibility in blowing snow. However, no reports of blizzard conditions have come out of Coral Harbour, yet. The winter storm watch remains in effect as there is the possibility that some areas are experiencing visibilities of 400 metres or less in blowing snow. Winds will begin to diminish overnight, and the blizzard potential will cease and the winter storm watch will be ended.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to NUstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #NUStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-11-18T07:59:18-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-11-17T20:28:18-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3564951352.2020<br>Area: Coral Harbour",
