				"Summary" : "Description: Heavy rain for the Central Interior, Cariboo-Chilcotin, Thompson and Columbia regions though Thursday evening. \n\nMoist easterly flow associated with a deep Alberta low will stream moisture across the Rocky Mountains and into B.C. tonight and Thursday. \n\nComputer guidance continues to suggest that 25 to 40 mm total rainfall will fall through Thursday night. Higher rainfall amounts are expected over the mountains, especially over the Williston, McGregor, and Cariboo regions where storm totals will reach 50 to 70 mm. In addition to the widespread synoptic rain, thunderstorms will have the potential of adding 15-25 mm locally over short periods.\n\nAlthough the rainfall amounts may not be exceptionally heavy, the significance of this event is due to the potential for rising rivers levels. There is significant concern for high flows in the Quesnel River (Cariboo Mountains), the North Thompson (Blue River/Clearwater region), and South Thompson (Shuswap). \n\nOn Thursday the precipitation will become more showery in nature, but  thunderstorms will cause significant local contribution to rainfall totals well into Thursday evening.  \n\nRainfall warnings may be issued as the system further develops and confidence in rainfall amounts increases.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-02T17:24:29-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-02T01:25:29-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1314327348.2020<br>Area: Fraser Canyon - north including Lillooet, South Thompson, Nicola, Shuswap, North Thompson, North Columbia, Chilcotin, Cariboo - north including Quesnel, Cariboo - south including Williams Lake, 100 Mile, Yellowhead, Williston, Prince George, McGregor",
