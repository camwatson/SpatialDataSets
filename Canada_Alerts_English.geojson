				"Summary" : "Description: A wintry mix of inland snow and coastal rain is expected.\n\nTime span: Sunday night until Monday night.\n\nLocations: Red Bay to L'Anse-au-Clair.\n\nTotal snowfall: 10 to 20 cm inland and over higher terrain, especially north of Red bay.\nTotal rainfall: 10 to 15 mm along the coast.\n\nRemarks: Road conditions will likely deteriorate quickly, especially over areas towards Red Bay and beyond. There is still some uncertainty as to how far north the mild air and rain will extend; a snowfall warning may be required if the track of the weather system changes.\n\nFor travel considerations: A snowfall warning is in effect for Norman Bay to Lodge Bay, and a winter storm warning is in effect for the Eagle River section of the Trans-Labrador Highway.  Travel is not recommended through those areas from Sunday night to Tuesday morning due to heavy snowfall and reduced visibility in blowing snow.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Travel will be hazardous over inland routes due to accumulating snow and reduced visibility in blowing snow.  Along the coast, especially from Norman Bay to Lodge Bay, temperatures will be near zero, which may cause the snow to mix with or change over to rain on Monday.  Accumulations will be lower along the coast.\n\nConditions will likely improve at some point on Tuesday as snow tapers to flurries.\n\nFor travel considerations: A winter storm warning is in effect for the Eagle River section of the Trans-Labrador Highway.\n\n###\n\nRoad closures are possible.\n\nSnowfall warnings are issued when significant snowfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
