				"Summary" : "Description: Rain, at times heavy, is expected. The ground, already near saturation, has little ability to absorb further rainfall.\n\nA low pressure system moving northwards across Alberta will spread rain to the Fort Nelson and Muncho Lake - Stone Mountain Park regions today. Rain heavy at times has started in Fort Nelson and will spread to the Rockies this afternoon. The rain will persist through Monday. Total rainfall amounts of 50 to 90 mm can be expected by Monday evening. \n\nGiven the wet antecedent conditions in the region this past month (including a similar weather system last weekend), the ground is already saturated in many areas. The prolonged moderate to heavy rainfall may result in higher overland runoff. \n\nFlood warnings and advisories from the BC River Forecast Centre can be found at: http://bcrfc.env.gov.bc.ca/warnings/index.htm .\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The ground, already near saturation, has little ability to absorb further rainfall.\n\nA low pressure system moving northwards across Alberta will spread rain to the Fort Nelson and Muncho Lake - Stone Mountain Park regions today. Rain heavy at times has started in Fort Nelson and will spread to the Rockies this afternoon. The rain will persist through Monday. Total rainfall amounts of 50 to 90 mm can be expected by Monday evening. \n\nGiven the wet antecedent conditions in the region this past month (including a similar weather system last weekend), the ground is already saturated in many areas. The prolonged moderate to heavy rainfall may result in higher overland runoff. \n\nFlood warnings and advisories from the BC River Forecast Centre can be found at: http://bcrfc.env.gov.bc.ca/warnings/index.htm .\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
