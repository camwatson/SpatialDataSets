This watch will be updated later today as this system develops over southern Alberta and more certainty is gained in where the heaviest band of snow will track.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.

Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice. \n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted.  Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-03-14T04:16:50-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
