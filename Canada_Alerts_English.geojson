				"Summary" : "Description: A long period of snowfall with total amounts of 15 to 25 cm is expected.\n\nA slow moving low pressure trough will give snow to Manitoba over the next couple of days. In the Red River Valley and Interlake, freezing drizzle will transition to snow this morning, with up to 10 cm today followed by another 5 to 10 cm tonight and a few more on Friday. \n\nIn southeastern Manitoba near the Ontario border, precipitation will fall mainly as rain today, but freezing rain is likely for several hours tonight before transitioning to snow. Snow will continue all day Friday with totals of 10 to 20 cm. \n\nSnow will push northward from Norway House to Thompson, Brochet, and Tadoule Lake today, lingering through Friday and into Saturday as it gradually shifts towards Gillam, Shamattawa and Churchill. Snowfall warnings may also be required for these latter communities at some point in the next day or two. \n\nTotal snowfall amounts of 15 to 25 cm are likely east of the Red River Valley and through central and northern Manitoba. Amounts will taper down as you go west from the Red River with little in the way of new snow forecast for Brandon.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
