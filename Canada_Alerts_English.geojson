				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions will be favourable for the development of funnel clouds today.\n\nFunnel clouds will be possible today as showers and thunderstorms move across southern Saskatchewan. They are most likely to occur this afternoon through the early evening.\n\nNo significant tornado threat is forecast, but ECCC advises all to remain alert if one is spotted. Funnel clouds can produce short-lived landspout tornadoes with little notice.\n\n###\n\nThese types of funnel clouds are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nLandspout tornadoes do not usually cause significant damage but can still be dangerous. They can be strong enough to topple trees, damage roofs or toss debris short distances.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
