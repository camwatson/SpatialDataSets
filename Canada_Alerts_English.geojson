A front has tracked down the BC coast and combined with a cool airmass to produce snow across the lowlands.  \n\nSnowfall amounts have varied significantly across the region and up to 15 cm of heavy, wet snow has fallen overnight. An additional 5 cm is expected this morning for the central and eastern Fraser Valley.\n\nOver the western Fraser Valley including Abbotsford snow has become mixed with rain overnight. Significant widespread snow accumulation is no longer expected, but local amounts of 2 to 4 cm of heavy wet snow is still possible early this morning.\n\nPrecipitation will change to rain later this morning.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.

The snow is expected to transition through ice pellets and freezing rain and eventually over to rain over southeastern Newfoundland Friday and Friday night as temperatures gradually rise above zero.  An extended period of  freezing precipitation is likely during this time. Rainfall will be most significant over the Burin and southern Avalon peninsulas. \n\nThe system is also expected to bring a combination of storm surge and large waves and pounding surf to Newfoundland's south coast.  Higher than normal water levels and a risk of coastal flooding will be possible on Saturday morning, especially near high tide for communities exposed to the southwest.  \n\nConditions are expected to improve throughout the day on Saturday as the system moves out to sea.  Precipitation will likely taper off to showers and flurries on Saturday morning, while strong southwesterly winds continue into the afternoon.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The snow is expected to transition through ice pellets and freezing rain and eventually over to rain over southeastern Newfoundland Friday and Friday night as temperatures gradually rise above zero.  An extended period of  freezing precipitation is likely during this time.    \n\nSnowfall will be highest over western, central and northeastern regions with significant accumulations possible.  On Friday night, increasing winds and falling temperatures will accompany the snow and generate blowing snow giving reduced visibilities, especially over exposed areas.\n\nThe system is also expected to bring large waves, pounding surf, higher than normal water levels and a risk of coastal flooding to southern parts of the Island Saturday morning, especially near high tide.  \n\nConditions are expected to improve throughout the day on Saturday as the system moves out to sea, though gusty northerly winds behind the system will continue throughout the day giving flurries and blowing snow in the onshore flow and as temperatures drop.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The snow is expected to change over to ice pellets and freezing rain over most of Nova Scotia Thursday night, and an extended period of freezing rain is possible Thursday night and Friday as temperatures hover near zero. In the southwest, however, a changeover to rain is expected on Thursday.\n\nThere remains uncertainty in how far north the changeover to mixed precipitation will occur which will affect the amount and location of the most intense freezing rain and rain.\n\nWarnings may be issued with future forecasts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
