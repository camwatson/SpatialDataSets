Follow your physician's instructions regarding the amount of fluid to drink;\nAvoid alcoholic beverages;\nIf you can, spend at least 2 hours a day in an air-conditioned or cool location;\nTake at least one cool shower or bath per day, or cool your skin several times per day with wet towels;\nLimit physical activity;\nWear light clothes.\n\nBe sure to:\nNever leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle or a poorly ventilated room, even for a few minutes;\nCheck on your loved ones, especially those who are vulnerable or living alone.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding your health condition, call Info-Santé at 8-1-1 or ask a health care provider.
