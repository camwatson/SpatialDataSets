A flash freeze warning may be issued later today as a result. \n\nIf the low tracks even a little further south than currently expected, the cold air could arrive sooner resulting in a threat of freezing rain today.\n\nMotorists should be prepared for poor winter driving conditions tonight as much colder air arrives and temperatures plunge to well below freezing.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Although there will be a patchy freezing drizzle in the morning, the more significant threat of freezing rain will be in the afternoon and early evening. Several hours of freezing rain are likely in some areas.\n\nSeveral millimetres of ice accretion are possible with some areas likely receiving several centimetres of snow in addition to the freezing rain.\n\nFreezing rain will change to all snow towards midnight as much colder air arrives in from the north in the wake of the low.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Ice build-up may cause tree branches to break.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
