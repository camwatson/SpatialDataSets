Forecast winds are expected to remain light out of the southwest today and tonight. These smoke plumes may affect the region for a few days. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-03T06:58:05-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-02T14:59:05-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.4274489435.2019<br>Area: Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell",

				"Summary" : "Description: Possible high levels of air pollution due to smoke from forest fires is expected today and tonight. \n\nSmoke plumes from numerous forest fires in the region are moving over the area. Forecast winds are expected to remain light out of the west or southwest today and tonight. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\nThese smoke plumes may affect the region for a few days.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nIn general, wearing a mask is not the best way to protect your health during a smoke event. In fact, masks may lead to a false sense of security, which may encourage increased physical activity and time spent outdoors, meaning increased exposure to smoke. They can also make breathing more difficult.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-03T06:59:12-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-02T15:00:12-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2005655945.2019<br>Area: Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake",
