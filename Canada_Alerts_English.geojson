This line is moving northeast at 40 km/h.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2020-07-08T00:00:06-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-07T22:03:06-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1441878744.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Enterprise including Richmound, R.M. of Fox Valley including Fox Valley, R.M. of Big Stick including Golden Prairie, R.M. of Pittville including Hazlet, R.M. of Piapot including Piapot, R.M. of Maple Creek including Maple Creek, R.M. of Maple Creek including Cypress Hills Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing damaging wind gusts, damaging hail and heavy rain.\n\nWith an approaching low pressure system, severe thunderstorms will develop over the southwestern portion of SK. These thunderstorms will initially be discrete before coalescing into a line in the late evening and overnight period. This watch area will likely be expanded to the west as the situation develops.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

This line is moving northeast at 40 km/h.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2020-07-08T01:11:31-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-07T22:44:31-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.4236505416.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Happyland including Leader Prelate and Mendham, R.M. of Fox Valley including Fox Valley, R.M. of Big Stick including Golden Prairie, R.M. of Clinworth including Sceptre Lemsford and Portreeve, R.M. of Miry Creek including Abbey Lancer and Shackleton, R.M. of Pittville including Hazlet, R.M. of Piapot including Piapot, R.M. of Gull Lake including Gull Lake and Tompkins, R.M. of Carmichael including Carmichael, R.M. of Arlington including Dollard, R.M. of White Valley including Eastend and Ravenscrag, R.M. of Frontier including Frontier and Claydon",
