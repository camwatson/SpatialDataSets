				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls may develop this evening and possibly persist through Saturday.\n\nLocally heavy snow squalls are expected to develop this evening as strong southwesterly winds develop off of Lake Ontario. These snow squalls could possibly last until Saturday afternoon.\n\nSnowfall amounts of 15 to 25 cm are possible by Saturday afternoon.\n\nGiven the strong winds gusting 60 to 80 km/h, areas of near zero visibilities in blowing snow and heavy falling snow could make travel hazardous across the region.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Road closures are possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls may develop this afternoon and possibly persist through Saturday morning.\n\nLocally heavy snow squalls are expected to develop this afternoon as strong southwesterly winds develop off of Lake Erie. These snow squalls could possibly last until Saturday morning. These snow squall bands could shift across the region which could limit the snowfall amount over a given location.  \nLocal snowfall amounts near 15 cm are possible with these snow squalls. However, if the strongest snow squall from Lake Erie is able to lock in and become stationary for a few hours, snowfall amounts of up to 25 cm are possible.\n\nGiven the strong southwesterly winds gusting up to 80 km/h, areas of near zero visibility in blowing snow and heavy snow will be a concern. Motorists should consider changing travel plans accordingly.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Road closures are possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
