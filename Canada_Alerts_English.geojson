These severe thunderstorms have produced nickel to golfball sized hail and locally heavy downpours. These thunderstorms will persist into the evening and continue to track eastward. Strong gusty winds and large hail are likely this evening.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.<br>Expires: 2019-06-30T02:04:52-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-06-29T23:08:52-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3302703827.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Dauphin incl.

These severe thunderstorms have produced nickel to golfball sized hail and locally heavy downpours. These thunderstorms will persist into the evening and continue to track eastward. Strong gusty winds and large hail are likely this evening.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.<br>Expires: 2019-06-30T02:22:14-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-06-30T00:04:14-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3278343110.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Grahamdale incl.

Severe thunderstorms will persist through this evening.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops.

These severe thunderstorms have produced nickel to golfball sized hail and locally heavy downpours. These thunderstorms will persist into the evening and continue to track eastward. Strong gusty winds and large hail are likely this evening.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.<br>Expires: 2019-06-30T03:22:33-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-06-30T00:24:33-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2714650607.2019<br>Area: Waterhen Meadow Portage and Skownan, R.M. of Grahamdale incl.
