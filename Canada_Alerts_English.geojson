Visibilities will be very low in the falling snow and travel will be affected. \n\nThe snowfall rapidly weakens in the wake of this system. Regions towards the Alberta border had some heavy snow earlier today but have since improved.  The heavy snow in Saskatoon and the Martensville region has weakened  and the snowfall in the Prince Albert region will ease by evening.  The heavy snowfall will push entirely out of Saskatchewan and into Manitoba late this evening.\n\nTravel will still be difficult for a time after this warning ends due to the heavy snow accumulations.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
