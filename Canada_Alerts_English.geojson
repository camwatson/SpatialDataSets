				"Summary" : "Description: Smoky Skies Bulletin - May 24, 2019\n\nSeveral regions in BC are being impacted or are likely to be impacted by wildfire smoke over the next 24-48 hours. The next bulletin update will be available May 26,2019.\n\nThe bulletin can be accessed online at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air/air-quality/air-advisories.\n\n\nRegions included under this bulletin:\n\nMuncho Lake Park - Stone Mountain Park: includes Muncho Lake, Toad River and Stone Mountain Provincial Park\n\nWatson Lake: includes Liard River, Lower Post and extends north to the Yukon border \n\nFort Nelson: includes Fort Nelson, Muskwa, Prophet River, Buckinghorse River, Sikanni Chief, Hwy 77 north to the Yukon border,\n\nWilliston: includes McLeod Lake, Mackenzie and Williston Lake\n\nB.C. North Peace River: includes the City of Fort St John and all communities along Hwy 97 extending from Farmington to Pink Mountain; Hwy 29 including Moberly Lake, Hudson’s Hope; also includes Rolla, Clayhurst and Goodlow \n\nB.C. South Peace River: includes Chetwynd, Dawson Creek, Pouce Coupe, and Tumbler Ridge\n\nMcGregor: includes the northern end of the Robson Valley extending from Hansard to Dome Creek; extends north to Monkmon Park.\n\nBe informed:\nDuring  a  wildfire,  smoke  conditions can  change  quickly  over  short  distances  and  can  vary  considerably hour-by-hour. \n\nWildfire smoke is a natural part of our environment but it is   important to be mindful that exposure to smoke may affect   your health. \n\nPeople with pre-existing health conditions, the elderly, infants, children and sensitive individuals are more likely to   experience health effects from smoke exposure.\n\nFollow your common sense:\n-Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes difficult or you feel unwell.\n-Stay cool and drink plenty of fluids.\n-Carry any rescue medications with you at all times.\n-Make sure that children and others who cannot care for themselves follow the same advice. Monitor your symptoms\n-Different people have different responses to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears.\n-People with asthma or other chronic illness should activate the personal care plans they have designed with their family physicians.\n-If you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC at 8-1-1.\n-If you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your health care provider, walk-in clinic, or emergency department. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1. \n\nTips to reduce your exposure:\n-Smoke levels may be lower indoors but will still be elevated, so stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.\n-Running a commercially available HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter can improve indoor air quality in the room where the device is located.\n-If you have a forced air heating/cooling system in your home, it may help to change the filter and set the fan to run continuously.\n-Reduce indoor air pollution sources such as smoking, burning incense, and frying foods.\n-Consider going to a library, community center, or shopping mall with cooler filtered air to get some relief from the smoke.\n-If travelling in a car with air conditioning, keep the windows up and the ventilation set to recirculate.\n-If you are very sensitive to smoke, consider moving to another location with cleaner air, but be aware that conditions can change rapidly.\n-Maintaining good overall health is a good way to prevent health effects resulting from short-term exposure to air pollution.\n\nMore information:\n-For general information about wildfire smoke and your health, contact HealthLinkBC:\n--Phone 8-1-1 (toll free, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week), or\n--Check the Wildfires and Your Health webpage at: https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-feature/wildfires.\n-The current Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and other air quality information is available at the BC Air Quality website, http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/bcairquality/readings/aqhi-table.xml.\n-Forecasts of smoke levels over the next 48 hours are available from the Environment and Climate Change Canada FireWork prediction system, https://weather.gc.ca/firework/indexe.html.\n-If you need to work outdoors in smoky conditions, material can be found at theWorkSafe  BC  Wildfire  FAQ  website,  https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/information-sheets/wildfire-smoke-frequently-asked-questions-faq.\n-First Nations Health Authority: http://www.fnha.ca/what-we-do/environmental-health/wildfire-information\n\nContact information:\nMedia and public inquiries regarding air quality and this bulletin: Gail Roth, Air Quality Meteorologist, Ministry of Environment & Climate Change Strat-egy, 250-565-4210.\n\nMedia questions regarding health implications of wildfires:\nFirst Nations Health Authority\nEnvironmental Public Health Services or Main FNHA Line: 604-693-6500\nAfter Hours: 1-844-666-0711\nEmail: Ephs.afterhours@fnha.ca\nMedia line: 604-831-4898\n\nNorthern Health Authority\nMedia Line: 1-877-961-7724\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-25T08:54:42-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility. Air quality sensors in northwestern Alberta continue to report increased concentrations of small particulate matter in the area.\n\nNortheasterly surface winds are pushing smoke to the southwest of the fires this evening, however, winds are forecast to shift to northerly which will likely cause smoke to affect more populated areas through Saturday.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-25T14:21:27-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-05-24T22:22:27-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1338808704.2019<br>Area: Co. of Grande Prairie near Beaverlodge Hythe and Demmitt, Co. of Grande Prairie near Sexsmith and La Glace, Co. of Grande Prairie near Grande Prairie and Wembley, M.D. of Greenview near Wapiti and Shuttler Flats Rec.
