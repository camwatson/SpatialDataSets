Steady winds and sufficient temperatures will allow for blowing snow in areas with fresh snowfall. \n\nA general 5 to 10 cm can be expected with locally 25 to 50 cm in areas where bands settle for longer, generally near Lake Huron. Poor visibility will be a concern throughout the watch area. \n\nThese snow squalls could potentially last into Saturday. However, winds will shift and the threat should likely remain closer to northern Lake Huron and Georgian Bay.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

This snow squall should get more intense over the next several hours. A weather spotter in Parkhill has reported 16 cm of snow so far from system snow and now this band as of 4:30 a.m.\n\nIntense snowfall rates may be possible for several hours this morning before the band shifts north this afternoon. Blowing snow may accompany this snow squall as well. Travel could be dangerous.\n\nNote: heavy snow from the main low pressure system will continue in these areas as well over the next few hours.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Locally snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 cm are expected, especially over higher terrain. Conditions will improve Saturday night.\n\nIn addition, higher than normal water levels are expected from Lunenburg east to Sheet Harbour near 4 am AST on Saturday. Wave heights of up to 6 metres are expected along the Atlantic coast beginning early Saturday and persisting most of the day.
