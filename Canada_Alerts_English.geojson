				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility in some areas.\n\nSome smoke is expected to push into central Alberta today and this alert will be expanded southward if smoke remains near the surface as it moves away from the fires.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-31T02:37:27-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-05-30T10:38:27-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.4104341342.2019<br>Area: Big Lakes County near Enilda and Joussard, Big Lakes County near Hilliard's Bay Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from forest fires in Alberta spread into Saskatchewan this afternoon.\n\nCurrent observations are indicating reduced visibilities and increased AQHI levels in some localities. The smoke is moving south and the duration of the special air quality statement will only be a few hours. \n\nAs the smoke moves south it will become more diffuse and the impacts will diminish. \n\nThe special air quality statement will be ended this evening.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nPlease call HealthLine 811 for advice on health risks, symptoms and precautions associated with air quality.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-31T06:07:12-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-05-30T22:27:12-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3877500812.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Deer Forks including Burstall and Estuary, R.M. of Happyland including Leader Prelate and Mendham, R.M. of Enterprise including Richmound, R.M. of Fox Valley including Fox Valley, R.M. of Big Stick including Golden Prairie, R.M. of Clinworth including Sceptre Lemsford and Portreeve, R.M. of Miry Creek including Abbey Lancer and Shackleton, R.M. of Pittville including Hazlet, R.M. of Piapot including Piapot, R.M. of Gull Lake including Gull Lake and Tompkins, R.M. of Carmichael including Carmichael, R.M. of Lacadena including Kyle Tyner and Sanctuary, R.M. of Victory including Beechy, R.M. of Canaan including Lucky Lake, R.M. of Riverside including Cabri Pennant and Success, R.M. of Saskatchewan Landing including Stewart Valley, R.M. of Webb including Webb and Antelope lake, R.M. of Swift Current including Swift Current and Wymark, R.M. of Lac Pelletier including Blumenhof, R.M. of Excelsior including Waldeck Rush Lake and Main Centre, R.M. of Morse including Herbert Morse Ernfold and Gouldtown, R.M. of Coulee including Neidpath and McMahon, R.M. of Lawtonia including Hodgeville, R.M. of Glen Bain including Glen Bain, R.M. of Whiska Creek including Vanguard Neville and Pambrun, City of Saskatoon, R.M. of Redberry including Hafford and Krydor, R.M. of Blaine Lake including Blaine Lake, R.M. of Great Bend including Radisson and Borden, R.M. of Laird including Waldheim Hepburn and Laird, R.M. of Rosthern including Rosthern Hague and Carlton, R.M. of Eagle Creek including Arelee and Sonningdale, R.M. of Corman Park including Martensville Warman and Langham, R.M. of Perdue including Perdue and Kinley, R.M. of Vanscoy including Delisle Asquith and Vanscoy, R.M. of Aberdeen including Aberdeen, R.M. of Fish Creek including Alvena, R.M. of Hoodoo including Wakaw and Cudworth, R.M. of Grant including Vonda Prud'homme and Smuts, R.M. of Bayne including Bruno Peterson and Dana, R.M. of Colonsay including Colonsay and Meacham, R.M. of Viscount including Viscount and Plunkett, R.M. of Blucher including Allan Clavet Bradwell and Elstow, R.M. of Harris including Harris and Tessier, R.M. of Montrose including Donovan and Swanson, R.M. of Milden including Dinsmore Milden and Wiseton, R.M. of Fertile Valley including Conquest Macrorie and Bounty, R.M. of King George northwest of Lucky Lake, R.M. of Coteau including Birsay and Danielson Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility in some areas.\n\nIn central parts of the province smoke is expected to move back north by Friday morning as the flow shifts to southeasterly.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-31T06:07:09-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-05-30T14:08:09-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0725169204.2019<br>Area: City of Lloydminster, Yellowhead Co. near Cadomin and Robb, Clearwater Co. near Chungo Creek, Clearwater Co. near Nordegg and Big Horn Res., Clearwater Co. near Ya-Ha-Tinda Ranch, Brazeau Co. near Cynthia and Lodgepole, Yellowhead Co. near Minnow and Wolf Lakes and Elk River, O'Chiese 203 Res. and Clearwater Co. near Sunchild Cree Res., Brazeau Co. near Brazeau Dam, Clearwater Co. near Rocky Mtn House and Crimson Lake, Clearwater Co. near Caroline and James River Bridge, Lacombe Co. near Eckville, Lacombe Co. near Lacombe Blackfalds and Bentley, Lacombe Co. near Clive Alix and Mirror, Red Deer Co. near Sylvan Lake and Stephansson House, Red Deer Co. near Spruce View and Red Lodge Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility in some areas.\n\nIn central parts of the province smoke is expected to move back north by Friday morning as the flow shifts to southeasterly.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-31T10:23:53-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-05-30T18:24:53-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3725852475.2019<br>Area: City of Lloydminster, Yellowhead Co. near Cadomin and Robb, Clearwater Co. near Chungo Creek, Clearwater Co. near Nordegg and Big Horn Res., Clearwater Co. near Ya-Ha-Tinda Ranch, Brazeau Co. near Cynthia and Lodgepole, Yellowhead Co. near Minnow and Wolf Lakes and Elk River, O'Chiese 203 Res. and Clearwater Co. near Sunchild Cree Res., Brazeau Co. near Brazeau Dam, Clearwater Co. near Rocky Mtn House and Crimson Lake, Clearwater Co. near Caroline and James River Bridge, Lacombe Co. near Eckville, Lacombe Co. near Lacombe Blackfalds and Bentley, Lacombe Co. near Clive Alix and Mirror, Red Deer Co. near Sylvan Lake and Stephansson House, Red Deer Co. near Spruce View and Red Lodge Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility in some areas.\n\nIn central parts of the province smoke is expected to move back north by Friday morning as the flow shifts to southeasterly.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-31T04:23:02-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-05-30T12:24:02-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3302283862.2019<br>Area: City of Lloydminster, Lac La Biche Co. near Plamondon Hylo and Avenir, Lac La Biche Co. near Heart Lake, Lac La Biche Co. near Lac La Biche and Square Lake, Lac La Biche Co. near Lakeland Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility in some areas. At 3 pm the area of smoke extends from northwestern Alberta through Whitecourt then towards Hanna and is slumping southwards.  \n\nIn central and southern parts of the province smoke is expected to move back north by Friday morning as the flow shifts to southeasterly.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-31T13:28:15-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-05-30T21:29:15-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3436088111.2019<br>Area: City of Lloydminster, Jasper Nat.
