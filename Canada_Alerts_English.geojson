				"Summary" : "Description: Warning of potential breaking sea conditions and overwash issued jointly by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (Science) and the Meteorological Service of Canada - Quebec Region on 2020-12-14.\n\nHigher than normal water levels and large waves are expected near the coast during the concerned period.\n\nAn intense low pressure system near Newfoundland will cause very strong to high winds over the regions listed below. The combination of these winds and the fact that we are currently in a period of high tidal range may produce minor breaking sea conditions along the coast near these localities, on the dates and at the times specified (Eastern standard time):\n\n\nKamouraska - Rivière-du-Loup - Trois-Pistoles: 2020-12-15, from 01:00 PM to 04:30 PM.\n\nRimouski - Mont-Joli: 2020-12-15, from 12:30 PM to 04:00 PM.\n\nMatane: 2020-12-15, from 12:30 PM to 04:00 PM.\n\nSainte-Anne-des-Monts - Grande-Vallée: 2020-12-15, from 12:00 PM to 03:30 PM.\n\n###\n\nCoastal erosion is possible in vulnerable areas.\n\nStorm surge warnings are issued when water levels pose a threat to coastal regions.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
