				"Summary" : "Description: Significant rainfall, mild temperatures, and snow melt are expected over the next several days.\n\nRainfall warnings are already in effect for today into tonight for Corner Brook and Vicinity and Bay St. George. Refer to the warning itself for further details on this event.  \n\nAfter the rainfall today, periods of rain are expected to return later Saturday or Saturday night and continue well into next week.  While it is too early to predict exact rainfall amounts, forecast guidance is suggesting the potential for well in excess of 50 mm over the next few days, with the highest amounts likely over higher elevations. The rain will combine with mild temperatures to cause significant snowmelt and an increased potential for localized flooding.\n\nFurther details will come in subsequent forecasts and updates. Should this scenario remain unchanged, rainfall warnings might need to be continued or expanded further up the West Coast of Newfoundland.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Significant rain on tap to start the Easter Weekend.\n\nTotal rainfall amounts of 25 to 50 millimetres are likely by Saturday as a series of low pressure systems from the Southern Plains states affect Southern Ontario. \n\nAlthough the ground is generally no longer frozen, it will still have a limited ability to absorb this rainfall. As a result, some ponding of water is possible in low-lying areas.\n\nThe rainfall warning criterion of 50 millimetres of rain within 24 hours is not expected to be reached in general. \n\nAt this point it looks like the rain will end in time for the Easter Bunny's journey on Easter Sunday morning.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-04-19T22:53:11-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-04-19T14:54:11-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2713512399.2019<br>Area: Simcoe - Delhi - Norfolk, Dunnville - Caledonia - Haldimand, Watford - Pinery Park - Eastern Lambton County, Sarnia - Petrolia - Western Lambton County, Chatham-Kent - Rondeau Park, Windsor - Leamington - Essex County, London - Parkhill - Eastern Middlesex County, Strathroy - Komoka - Western Middlesex County, St. Thomas - Aylmer - Eastern Elgin County, Rodney - Shedden - Western Elgin County, Woodstock - Tillsonburg - Oxford County, Brantford - County of Brant, City of Toronto, Uxbridge - Beaverton - Northern Durham Region, Newmarket - Georgina - Northern York Region, Pickering - Oshawa - Southern Durham Region, Vaughan - Richmond Hill - Markham, City of Hamilton, Wingham - Blyth - Northern Huron County, Listowel - Milverton - Northern Perth County, Goderich - Bluewater - Southern Huron County, Stratford - Mitchell - Southern Perth County, Mount Forest - Arthur - Northern Wellington County, Guelph - Erin - Southern Wellington County, Kitchener - Cambridge - Region of Waterloo, Innisfil - New Tecumseth - Angus, Shelburne - Mansfield - Northern Dufferin County, Orangeville - Grand Valley - Southern Dufferin County, Caledon, Mississauga - Brampton, Halton Hills - Milton, Burlington - Oakville, St. Catharines - Grimsby - Northern Niagara Region, Niagara Falls - Welland - Southern Niagara Region",

Manitoba Infrastructure's Hydrologic Forecast Centre continues to issue a High Water Advisory for the Saskatchewan and Carrot Rivers near the Town of The Pas.
