				"Summary" : "Description: At 8:29 p.m. CST, Environment Canada meteorologists are tracking a line of dangerous thunderstorms capable of producing very strong wind gusts, up to golf ball size hail and heavy rain.\n\nThis line of severe thunderstorms is currently located from near Limerick to Caron to Davidson to Humboldt and is tracking to the northeast at 20 km/h.\n\nGolf ball sized hail was recently reported near Parkbeg.\n\nVery heavy rainfall in excess of 50 mm per hour is likely with this line of thunderstorms.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Very large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2019-08-23T04:54:14-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-08-23T02:30:14-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2174304221.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Huron including Tugaske, R.M. of Craik including Craik and Aylesbury, R.M. of Sarnia including Holdfast Chamberlain and Dilke, R.M. of Marquis including Tuxford Keeler and Buffalo Pound, R.M. of Dufferin including Bethune and Findlater, R.M. of Caron including Caronport and Caron, R.M. of Moose Jaw including Pasqua and Bushell Park, City of Moose Jaw, R.M. of Hillsborough including Crestwynd and Old Wives lake, R.M. of Sutton including Mazenod Palmer and Vantage, R.M. of Stonehenge including Limerick and Congress, R.M. of Lake Johnson including Mossbank and Ardill, R.M. of Lake of The Rivers including Assiniboia, R.M. of Three Lakes including Middle Lake and St Benedict, R.M. of Lake Lenore including St. Brieux, R.M. of Pleasantdale including Naicam and Pleasantdale, R.M. of Grant including Vonda Prud'homme and Smuts, R.M. of Bayne including Bruno Peterson and Dana, R.M. of Colonsay including Colonsay and Meacham, R.M. of Viscount including Viscount and Plunkett, R.M. of Blucher including Allan Clavet Bradwell and Elstow, R.M. of Dundurn including Dundurn and Blackstrap Prov.

Very large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2019-08-23T04:54:22-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-08-23T02:03:22-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3913796575.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Huron including Tugaske, R.M. of Craik including Craik and Aylesbury, R.M. of Marquis including Tuxford Keeler and Buffalo Pound, R.M. of Wheatlands including Mortlach and Parkbeg, R.M. of Rodgers including Coderre and Courval, R.M. of Caron including Caronport and Caron, R.M. of Hillsborough including Crestwynd and Old Wives lake, R.M. of Sutton including Mazenod Palmer and Vantage, R.M. of Stonehenge including Limerick and Congress, R.M. of Waverley including Glentworth and Fir Mountain, R.M. of Old Post including Wood Mountain and Killdeer, R.M. of Lake Johnson including Mossbank and Ardill, R.M. of Lake of The Rivers including Assiniboia, R.M. of Three Lakes including Middle Lake and St Benedict, R.M. of Lake Lenore including St. Brieux, R.M. of Grant including Vonda Prud'homme and Smuts, R.M. of Bayne including Bruno Peterson and Dana, R.M. of Colonsay including Colonsay and Meacham, R.M. of Viscount including Viscount and Plunkett, R.M. of Blucher including Allan Clavet Bradwell and Elstow, R.M. of Dundurn including Dundurn and Blackstrap Prov.
