				"Summary" : "Description: Near zero visibility in fog is expected or occurring over some areas.\n\nLarge areas of dense fog reducing visibilities on highways are once again forming over much of southeastern Alberta. In addition to the reduced visibility, the fog may create a thin layer of ice on roads making for slippery road conditions.\n\nThese areas of fog are expected to expand and persist until the late overnight hours and potentially until Saturday morning.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

In addition to the reduced visibility, the fog may create a thin layer of ice on roads making for slippery road conditions.\n\nThese areas of fog are expected to expand and persist until the late overnight hours and potentially until Saturday morning.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
