Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted.  Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at  https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-03-20T09:02:49-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

Given that the showers and thunderstorms are expected to be scattered, strong wind gusts will only affect some areas with low confidence as to the locales most likely to be affected. \n\nPower outages are expected where high wind gusts occur.\n\nEnvironment Canada will continue to monitor this situation closely.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted.  Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at  https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-03-20T03:56:19-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

				"Summary" : "Description: ROAD DUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR BURNS LAKE, SMITHERS AND QUESNEL\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Northern Health has continued a Road Dust Advisory for Burns Lake and Smithers because of high concentrations of coarse particulate matter that are expected to persist until there is precipitation or dust suppression.  Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted.  Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at  https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-03-20T08:43:51-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

Showers and Scattered Thunderstorms Tonight into Friday with up to 25 mm Possible in Some Areas.\n  \nAn approaching warm front will cause an area of showers and thunderstorms to move through the regions this evening and tonight.  Some of the storms may contain heavy downpours with local rainfall amounts of 15 mm in an hour or total amounts near 25 mm possible. \n\nThere will be the potential for high wind gusts Friday in the morning or early afternoon as a cold front approaches, preceded by a band of scattered showers and thunderstorms.  Scattered winds gusts near or exceeding 90 km/h or more will be possible in this band.  Given the scattered nature of the band, confidence in high winds gusts occurring in any given locale is low.\n\nWhere these winds develop, power outages would likely occur. \n\nEnvironment Canada will continue to monitor this situation closely and may issue watches or warnings as the event draws nearer.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

There is the risk that isolated thunderstorms overnight could contain wind gusts to 90 km/h.\n\nA greater threat for high wind gusts is expected Friday morning into early afternoon as a cold front approaches, preceded by a band of scattered showers and thunderstorms.  There will be potential for wind gusts near or in excess of 90 km/h as the band moves through.\n\nShould these winds develop, power outages would likely occur in some areas.\n\nEnvironment Canada will continue to monitor this situation closely and may issue watches or warnings as the event draws nearer.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
