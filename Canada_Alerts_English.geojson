				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of squalls with wind gusts up to 35 knots, frequent lightning and hail.\n\nA low pressure system approaching from SK will allow convective initiation over the Manitoba lakes this afternoon, and these storms will have the risk of strong gusts and damaging hail. This squall watch may be extended as the situation develops.\n\nMariners are advised to prepare for potential squalls. Vulnerable vessels are most at risk and should seek safe harbour if underway.\n\nConsider delaying or postponing travel in areas under the squall watch.\n\nLarge hail can damage vessels and cause injury.\n\nVessels without lightning protection should make their way to shore immediately.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage vessels and cause injury.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. For more information monitor Canadian Coast Guard radio or Weatheradio stations.<br>Expires: 2020-07-18T00:28:37-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-17T16:30:37-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1310869049.2020<br>Area: Lake Winnipegosis, Lake Winnipeg - north basin, Lake Manitoba",

Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2020-07-17T21:29:06-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-17T19:46:06-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2720484812.2020<br>Area: Mun. of Norfolk Treherne, Mun. of Pembina incl.

Vulnerable vessels are most at risk and should seek safe harbour if underway.\n\nConsider delaying or postponing travel in areas under the squall watch.\n\nLarge hail can damage vessels and cause injury.\n\nVessels without lightning protection should make their way to shore immediately.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage vessels and cause injury.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
