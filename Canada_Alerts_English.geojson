The snow may possibly affect travel as far east as Cornwall. Travel may be hazardous for several hours in the morning due to rapidly accumulating snow, slippery conditions and reduced visibility. Generally 2 to 4 centimetres of snow is expected with locally higher amounts closer to the shorelines of Lake Ontario.  Temperatures are expected to rise above freezing during the middle to late morning and precipitation will become light or mix with showers giving improved travel conditions.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
