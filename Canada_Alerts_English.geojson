				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing large hail and heavy rain.\n\nA ridge of high pressure will continue to weaken over the southern BC interior today. Combined with warm surface temperatures, this will lead to unstable conditions and scattered thunderstorms across southeastern BC.\n\nWith strong wind shear and moisture moving in from the southwest, there is potential for some thunderstorms to become severe this afternoon and early this evening.\n\nThe greatest risk is currently seen over the North and Central Okanagan, Shuswap, Arrow Lakes - Slocan Lake, and West Columbia.\n\n###\n\nStrong wind gusts are also possible.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
