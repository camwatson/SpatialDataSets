				"Summary" : "Description: Significant snowfall still possible for southwestern Nova Scotia on Tuesday night and Wednesday, less likely elsewhere.\n\nTotal snowfall: possibly reaching 10 cm in the southwest, with only 2 to 5 cm now expected from Halifax eastward\n\nLocations: Atlantic coastal regions of Nova Scotia.\n\nTime span: Tuesday evening until noon Wednesday for Yarmouth County to Halifax Metro and Halifax County West. Wednesday morning to Wednesday evening for Halifax County - East of Porters Lake to Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County.\n\nRemarks: An approaching low pressure system is now expected to track further south of Nova Scotia than previously forecast on Tuesday night and Wednesday. Snow is still forecast to begin over southwestern Nova Scotia Tuesday afternoon and then spread eastward, reaching Cape Breton on Wednesday morning. However, total snowfall is now only expected to approach 10 cm over the South Shore from Yarmouth to Lunenburg Counties. \n\nDue to the uncertainty which remains in the forecast track, the snowfall forecast may be revised as the system approaches. In any case, this snowfall event has the potential to create difficult driving conditions in some areas during the Wednesday morning commute.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
