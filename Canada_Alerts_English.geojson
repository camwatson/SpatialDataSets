				"Summary" : "Description: Major winter storm to impact southern Saskatchewan this weekend.\n\nA powerful low pressure system will bring an abrupt return to winter this weekend. On Saturday, a early disturbance will begin affecting the northern grainbelt areas of the province, with 10 to 20 cm of snow expected for the day along with a risk of freezing rain.\n\nOn Sunday, the main system arrives, bringing more intense and widespread severe winter weather to the entire southern half of the province. Heavy snowfall will spread northeastward through the day accompanied by northerly winds gusting to 70 km/h or beyond. Blizzard conditions are possible and may continue into Sunday night. For the southeast, a milder start to the day will see accumulating rain and/or freezing rain also give way to the heavy snow with strong winds as temperatures steadily fall. \n\nWhile details in timing and intensity are likely to shift somewhat as the event approaches, current consensus indicates that 30 to 50 cm of snow will cover most of the watch area by Monday morning when the system finally departs.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
