Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nExposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women, infants, and older adults, as well as, individuals with conditions such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, diabetes or respiratory infections such as COVID-19. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until  the advisory is lifted. Where appropriate, maintain physical distancing. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at:\n\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-02-11T21:21:34-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
