It will start with a few hours of freezing rain followed by a mix of rain and snow. \n\nOver Southern sections including Timmins the precipitation should change to rain Monday afternoon with amounts of 15 to 25 mm by Tuesday morning. Over northern sections including Cochrane it will change to snow with local amounts of 10 cm by Tuesday morning.\n\nThere is some uncertainty about where the changeover from rain to snow will be with temperatures being very close to zero. Some areas will get a messy mix of both.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
