Snow is expected to begin early Monday morning for southern portions of the island, and will begin mid-morning for more northern regions. There is potential for the snow to mix with or change over to rain or ice pellets over southern portions of the Avalon Monday afternoon.\n\nStrong northeasterly winds followed by strong northwesterlies are also expected Monday and Monday night. Maximum gusts are most likely going to range between 60 and 80 km/h for most areas. Along the south and east coasts, there is a possibility gusts could reach 100 km/h. These strong winds will combine with snow to reduce visibility in blowing snow.\n\nConditions will improve on Tuesday morning.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nWinter storm watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

This will generate onshore flurries and local snow squalls Monday night and Tuesday.\n\nStrong northwesterly winds are also expected Monday night and Tuesday. Maximum gusts are most likely going to range between 60 and 80 km/h for most areas. For the Port aux Basques area, there is a possibility gusts could reach 100 km/h. These strong winds will combine with snow to reduce visibility in blowing snow.\n\nConditions will improve for most areas by the end of the day Tuesday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Maximum gusts are most likely going to range between 60 and 80 km/h for most areas.
