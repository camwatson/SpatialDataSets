				"Summary" : "Description: Flurries are expected over high elevation highway routes of the southern BC interior tonight.\n\nA vigorous cold front will cross the southern interior of BC tonight. Rain will begin this evening, but as cold air moves in behind the front snow levels will drop rapidly. As this happens rain will change to flurries over higher elevations.\n\n5 to 10 cm of snow is possible over higher elevations of the Coquihalla Highway - Hope to Merritt.\n\nThe Okanagan Connector - Pennask Summit, Highway 3 - Allison Pass, and Highway 3 - Paulson Summit to Kootenay Pass will likely see 2 to 5 cm.\n\nStrong, gusty winds are also possible with the passage of the front.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-05-03T04:37:34-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-05-02T12:38:34-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2151947717.2020<br>Area: Highway 3 - Hope to Princeton via Allison Pass, Highway 3 - Paulson Summit to Kootenay Pass, Coquihalla Highway - Hope to Merritt, Okanagan Connector - Merritt to Kelowna",
