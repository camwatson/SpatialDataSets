				"Summary" : "Description: Snow Squalls Tuesday and Tuesday night.\n\nSnow squalls are forecast to develop off Lake Huron and Georgian Bay Tuesday morning and then continue through Tuesday night. The most intense bands are likely Tuesday afternoon and evening with conditions slowly improving through by Wednesday morning as winds shift to the southwest. Strong winds will accompany these bands at times resulting in periods of blowing snow.\n\nLocal snowfall accumulations of 10 to 15 cm will be possible under the most intense bands by Wednesday morning.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
