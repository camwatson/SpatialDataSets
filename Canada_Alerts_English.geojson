				"Summary" : "Description: Early season snowfall over higher terrain and highway passes is possible tonight and Friday morning as a modified Arctic airmass arrives on the coast. Below seasonal temperatures will continue through the weekend.\n\nA low pressure system will pass just off Vancouver Island Friday morning and move onto the Washington coast Friday evening. Meanwhile, Arctic air will advance southward through the B.C. interior. The onset of precipitation combined with falling temperatures will bring the chance of snow and tricky driving conditions for Highway 19 between Campbell River and Port Hardy, Highway 28 to Gold River, and Highway 4 between Coombs and Port Alberni.\n\nA few cm's of snowfall is possible before becoming mixed with rain Friday afternoon.\n\nThe system will move out of the region Friday evening but a cold airmass settling in behind the system will ensure temperatures remain 5 to 8 degrees below seasonal normals.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Below seasonal temperatures to continue through the weekend.\n\nA low pressure system will pass just off Vancouver Island Friday morning and move onto the Washington coast late in the day. Meanwhile, modified Arctic air will advance southward through the B.C. interior. By Friday afternoon, the Arctic front is expected to reach Kamloops and pile up against the east side of the Rockies.\n\nWith a somewhat cool airmass already in place, widespread snow is expected from the Chilcotin and 100 MIle area to the Fraser Canyon and eastward to the Kootenays. Snow may become mixed with rain over southern and eastern portions of this area. Currently, forecast snowfall amounts may range from about 5 to 15 cm.\n\nThe system will move out of the province on Saturday but Arctic air will make its way through the rest of the southern interior. Temperatures of 10 degrees below seasonal normals are expected.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Below seasonal temperatures to continue through the weekend.\n\nA low pressure system will pass just off Vancouver Island Friday morning and move onto the Washington coast late in the day. Meanwhile, modified Arctic air will advance southward through the B.C. interior. By Friday afternoon, the Arctic front is expected to reach Kamloops and pile up against the east side of the Rockies.\n\nWith a somewhat cool airmass already in place, widespread snow is expected from the Chilcotin and 100 MIle area to the Fraser Canyon and eastward to the Kootenays. Snow may become mixed with rain over southern and eastern portions of this area. Currently, forecast snowfall amounts may range from about 5 to 15 cm.\n\nThe system will move out of the province on Saturday but Arctic air will make its way through the rest of the southern interior. Temperatures of 10 degrees below seasonal normals are expected.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: More early season snowfall expected on Friday as Arctic air arrives. Below seasonal temperatures to continue through the weekend.\n\nA low pressure system will pass just off Vancouver Island Friday morning and move onto the Washington coast Friday evening. Meanwhile, modified Arctic air will advance southward through the B.C. interior. By Friday afternoon, the Arctic front is expected to reach Kamloops and pile up against the east side of the Rockies.\n\nWith a somewhat cool airmass already in place, widespread snow is expected from Bella Coola and Whistler eastward to 100 Mile and the southwest interior, and further to the Kootenays and parts of the Columbias. Snow may become mixed with rain over southern and eastern portions of this area. Currently, forecast snowfall amounts range from 5 to 15 cm.\n\nIn the wake of the low, a drying trend begins on Saturday as the Arctic air spreads through the rest of the southern interior. Temperatures of 10 degrees below seasonal normals are expected through the weekend.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-10-23T10:01:04-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-10-22T18:02:04-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0450503678.2020<br>Area: Highway 3 - Hope to Princeton via Allison Pass, Highway 3 - Paulson Summit to Kootenay Pass, Highway 97 - Clinton to 100 Mile House via Begbie Summit, Coquihalla Highway - Hope to Merritt, Coquihalla Highway - Merritt to Kamloops, Okanagan Connector - Merritt to Kelowna, Trans-Canada Highway - Eagle Pass to Rogers Pass, Sea to Sky - Squamish to Whistler",

Below seasonal temperatures to continue through the weekend.\n\nA low pressure system will pass just off Vancouver Island Friday morning and move onto the Washington coast Friday evening. Meanwhile, modified Arctic air will advance southward through the B.C. interior. By Friday afternoon, the Arctic front is expected to reach Kamloops and pile up against the east side of the Rockies.\n\nWith a somewhat cool airmass already in place, widespread snow is expected from the Chilcotin and 100 MIle area to the Fraser Canyon and eastward to the Kootenays and parts of the Columbias. Snow may become mixed with rain over southern and eastern portions of this area. Currently, forecast snowfall amounts range from 5 to 15 cm.\n\nIn the wake of the low, a drying trend begins on Saturday as the Arctic air spreads through the rest of the southern interior. Temperatures of 10 degrees below seasonal normals are expected through the weekend.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: More early season snowfall expected on Friday as Arctic air arrives. Below seasonal temperatures to continue through the weekend.\n\nA low pressure system will pass just off Vancouver Island Friday morning and move onto the Washington coast Friday evening. Meanwhile, modified Arctic air will advance southward through the B.C. interior. By Friday afternoon, the Arctic front is expected to reach Kamloops and pile up against the east side of the Rockies.\n\nWith a somewhat cool airmass already in place, widespread snow is expected from the Chilcotin and 100 MIle area to the Fraser Canyon and eastward to the Kootenays and parts of the Columbias. Snow may become mixed with rain over southern and eastern portions of this area. Currently, forecast snowfall amounts range from 5 to 15 cm.\n\nIn the wake of the low, a drying trend begins on Saturday as the Arctic air spreads through the rest of the southern interior. Temperatures of 10 degrees below seasonal normals are expected through the weekend.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
