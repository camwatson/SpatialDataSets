				"Summary" : "Description: A period of very cold wind chills is expected.\n\nExtreme cold wind chills of minus 40 or colder continue in parts of southern Manitoba this morning.\n\nAn Arctic ridge of high pressure continues to give frigid temperatures to portions of the southern prairies. Temperatures in the minus thirties along with winds of 10 to 15 km/h will produce extreme cold windchills of minus 40 or colder. Some moderation will occur later this morning but these wind chill values are expected to return one last time over sections of the Interlake and eastern Manitoba tonight into Thursday morning.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nFor more information on cold and your health, visit Manitoba Health at https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/cold.html or call Health Links - Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Temperatures in the minus thirties along with winds of 10 to 15 km/h will produce extreme cold windchills of minus 40 or colder. Some moderation will occur later this morning but these wind chill values could resume one last time over sections of the Interlake and/or eastern Manitoba tonight into Thursday morning.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
