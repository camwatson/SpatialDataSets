				"Summary" : "Description: Snow on the way beginning tonight into Tuesday morning.\n\nA low pressure system will emerge from Texas and track towards the Great Lakes today. This system will bring an area of snow with it, arriving tonight east of Georgian Bay. The snow will arrive Tuesday morning near and east of the National Capital region. Total snowfall amounts near 10 cm appear likely in most areas, with locally higher amounts up to 15 cm possible in the Ottawa Valley by the time the snow moves out of the area Tuesday evening. \n\nThere is some uncertainty as to the exact track of the low, which will affect how much snow falls at a particular location. \n\nPoor winter driving conditions from accumulating snow and low visibility in areas of heavier snow are expected beginning tonight. Motorists should be prepared to adjust their travel plans accordingly.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
