Afternoon highs in the upper twenties will combine with the humidity to create humidex values in the mid thirties. Temperatures on Tuesday should be a few degrees cooler with lesser humidity.\n\nThese conditions pose a health risk when you are not used to the heat. Everyone is at risk from heat, especially older adults, infants and young children, and people with chronic illnesses. You are advised to 1) drink plenty of cool liquids before feeling thirsty; and 2) keep cool by dressing for the weather and spending a few hours each day in a cool place.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing damaging wind gusts and damaging hail.\n\nA developing low pressure system over Alberta is introducing favourable conditions for the development of thunderstorms in central Saskatchewan late this afternoon and evening. It is expected that storms may be isolated initially, and some may become severe with threats of hail and wind. As time progresses, these storms will coalesce into a larger complex with strong winds being the primary severe weather threat. As this event progresses, it is expected that the watch area will be expanded.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts and large hail.\n\nA developing low pressure system over Alberta is introducing favourable conditions for the development of thunderstorms in central Saskatchewan late this evening. It is expected that storms may be isolated initially, and some may become severe with threats of hail and wind. As time progresses, these storms will coalesce into a larger complex with strong winds being the primary severe weather threat. As this event progresses, it is expected that the watch area will be expanded.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing damaging wind gusts and damaging hail.\n\nA developing low pressure system over Alberta is introducing favourable conditions for the development of thunderstorms in central Saskatchewan this afternoon and evening. It is expected that storms may be isolated initially, and some may become severe with threats of hail and wind.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nA developing low pressure system will bring rain, strong winds, and thunderstorms to much of central Alberta today. Some of these thunderstorms may become severe in nature.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ABstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ABStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-06-01T06:59:01-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-05-31T16:37:01-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3682287257.2020<br>Area: Lacombe Co. near Eckville, Lacombe Co. near Lacombe Blackfalds and Bentley, Lacombe Co. near Clive Alix and Mirror, Red Deer Co. near Sylvan Lake and Stephansson House, Red Deer Co. near Spruce View and Red Lodge Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nA developing low pressure system is bringing rain, strong winds, and thunderstorms to much of central Alberta today. Some of these thunderstorms may become severe in nature.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ABstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ABStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-06-01T07:59:12-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-05-31T21:16:12-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0896305002.2020<br>Area: Lacombe Co. near Eckville, Lacombe Co. near Lacombe Blackfalds and Bentley, Lacombe Co. near Clive Alix and Mirror, Red Deer Co. near Sylvan Lake and Stephansson House, Red Deer Co. near Spruce View and Red Lodge Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nA developing low pressure system is bringing rain, strong winds, and thunderstorms to much of central Alberta today. Some of these thunderstorms may become severe in nature.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ABstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ABStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-06-01T07:59:08-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-05-31T21:27:08-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2569565631.2020<br>Area: Lacombe Co. near Eckville, Lacombe Co. near Lacombe Blackfalds and Bentley, Lacombe Co. near Clive Alix and Mirror, Red Deer Co. near Sylvan Lake and Stephansson House, Red Deer Co. near Spruce View and Red Lodge Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nA developing low pressure system will bring rain, strong winds, and thunderstorms to much of central Alberta today. Some of these thunderstorms may become severe in nature.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ABstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ABStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-06-01T06:59:38-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-05-31T20:33:38-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0651400916.2020<br>Area: City of Lloydminster, Co. of Two Hills near Two Hills and Brosseau, Co. of Two Hills near Myrnam and Derwent, Co. of Minburn near Innisfree Lavoy and Ranfurly, Co. of Minburn near Minburn and Mannville, Beaver Co. near Viking and Kinsella, Flagstaff Co. near Killam and Sedgewick, Flagstaff Co. near Lougheed and Hardisty, Flagstaff Co. near Alliance and Bellshill Lake, Co. of Vermilion River near Vermilion, Co. of Vermilion River near Islay and McNabb Sanctuary, Co. of Vermilion River near Dewberry and Clandonald, Co. of Vermilion River near Tulliby Lake, Co. of Vermilion River near Kitscoty and Marwayne, Co. of Vermilion River near Paradise Valley, M.D. of Wainwright near Irma, M.D. of Wainwright near Wainwright, M.D. of Wainwright near Edgerton and Koroluk Landslide, M.D. of Wainwright near Chauvin Dillberry Lake and Roros, M.D. of Provost near Hughenden Amisk and Kessler, M.D. of Provost near Czar Metiskow and Cadogan, M.D. of Provost near Provost and Hayter, Leduc Co. near Warburg Thorsby and Pigeon Lake, Leduc Co. near Calmar and Devon, Brazeau Co. near Drayton Valley and Breton, Co. of Wetaskiwin near Pigeon Lake, Co. of Wetaskiwin near Alder Flats and Winfield, Ponoka Co. near Rimbey Bluffton and Hoadley, Ponoka Co. near Crestomere, Leduc Co. near Leduc Beaumont and Kavanagh, Leduc Co. near New Sarepta and Rolly View, Co. of Wetaskiwin near Wetaskiwin Millet and Hwy 2, Strathcona Co. near Ardrossan and Cooking Lake, Beaver Co. near Tofield, Beaver Co. near Holden and Ryley, Camrose Co. near Hay Lakes and Miquelon Lake Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nA developing low pressure system is bringing rain, strong winds, and thunderstorms to much of central Alberta today. Some of these thunderstorms may become severe in nature.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
