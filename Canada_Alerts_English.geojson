				"Summary" : "Description: A weather system moving in from southern Alberta will spread snow into west-central Saskatchewan around midnight. The snow will then push eastward across the northern grainbelt on Tuesday. Southern and east-central Saskatchewan however will experience mostly rain with this system, although some areas will change over to flurries as colder air comes in later in the day. \n\nThere is also a risk of freezing rain beginning late this evening in the Kindersley region, spreading through Saskatoon and Melfort overnight and Tuesday morning. North Battleford and Prince Albert also have a risk of freezing rain, although it is more likely south of those communities. \n\nThe situation will be monitored closely, and freezing rain warnings may be required as precipitation from the system starts to move in. \n\nSome accumulating snow is also expected, with 2 to 4 cm likely at Saskatoon but 5 to 10 cm through North Battleford and Prince Albert. Meadow Lake will receive the most with up to 15 cm in their forecast. Currently a snowfall warning is in effect for Meadow Lake, but this may shift into other regions depending on the track of the system.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
