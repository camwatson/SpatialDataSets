				"Summary" : "Description: Rainfall, combined with melting snow, is expected. The frozen ground has a reduced ability to absorb this rainfall.\n\nTotal rainfall: 20 to 40 mm, with locally higher amounts possible over higher terrain.\n\nLocations: the west coast of Newfoundland from Bay St. George to Hawke's Bay and the Deer Lake - Humber Valley area.\n\nTime span: continuing until Sunday afternoon.\n\nRemarks: Snow mixed with ice pellets will transition to rain at times heavy tonight. Heavy rainfall and very mild temperatures will quickly melt existing snow cover and contribute to an elevated risk of flooding, especially near rivers or creeks and in low lying areas.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Localized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
