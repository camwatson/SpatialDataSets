A few of these thunderstorms may become severe and persist well into the night as they track east towards the Interlake and Red River Valley. Thus, the watch area may expand east or northeast as required.\n\n###\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-07-14T09:23:58-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-13T21:24:58-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1456646603.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Wallace-Woodworth incl.
