				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls are expected to develop. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nTotal snowfall: 10 to 20 cm except locally 30 cm or more in snow squalls.\n\nLocations: the west coast of Newfoundland from Channel-Port aux Basques to Hawke's Bay.\n\nTime span: overnight tonight until Tuesday evening.\n\nRemarks: Strong westerly winds with gusts to 80 km/h or higher will cause blizzard like conditions, especially during heavier flurries and snow squalls.  This snow squall watch will likely need to be upgraded to a warning for some areas. \n\nAdditionally, wind warnings may be required for some areas beginning Monday night.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
