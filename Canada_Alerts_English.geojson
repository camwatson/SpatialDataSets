				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, damaging hail and torrential rain.\n\nSevere thunderstorms remain possible this evening in areas near the Manitoba border, but cooler air from the west is bringing an end to the threat in other regions.  The threat in eastern Saskatchewan should end before midnight.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
