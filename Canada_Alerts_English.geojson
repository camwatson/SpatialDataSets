				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls are expected. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nSnow squalls tonight.\n\nA strong snow squall off Southern Lake Huron extends from near Kettle Point across Wyoming towards the Bothwell area. This snow squall is expected to persist through the night before weakening to a few flurries by early Monday morning.\n\nSnowfall amounts up to 15 cm will be possible tonight with this snow squall. \n\nIn addition, sudden near zero visibility from bursts of heavy snow and blowing snow is expected. Dangerous winter driving conditions are likely tonight along Highway 402.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
