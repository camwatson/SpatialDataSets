The storms will move into the Elk Valley region within the hour.\n\nThese storms are capable of producing very strong wind gusts and heavy rain.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops.\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.<br>Expires: 2020-05-31T17:46:35-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-05-31T14:48:35-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1515246362.2020<br>Area: Elk Valley",

Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nA developing low pressure system will bring rain, strong winds, and thunderstorms to much of central Alberta today. Some of these thunderstorms may become severe in nature.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ABstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ABStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-06-01T06:59:01-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-05-31T16:37:01-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2931160463.2020<br>Area: City of Lloydminster, Co. of Two Hills near Two Hills and Brosseau, Co. of Two Hills near Myrnam and Derwent, Co. of Minburn near Innisfree Lavoy and Ranfurly, Co. of Minburn near Minburn and Mannville, Beaver Co. near Viking and Kinsella, Flagstaff Co. near Killam and Sedgewick, Flagstaff Co. near Lougheed and Hardisty, Flagstaff Co. near Alliance and Bellshill Lake, Co. of Vermilion River near Vermilion, Co. of Vermilion River near Islay and McNabb Sanctuary, Co. of Vermilion River near Dewberry and Clandonald, Co. of Vermilion River near Tulliby Lake, Co. of Vermilion River near Kitscoty and Marwayne, Co. of Vermilion River near Paradise Valley, M.D. of Wainwright near Irma, M.D. of Wainwright near Wainwright, M.D. of Wainwright near Edgerton and Koroluk Landslide, M.D. of Wainwright near Chauvin Dillberry Lake and Roros, M.D. of Provost near Hughenden Amisk and Kessler, M.D. of Provost near Czar Metiskow and Cadogan, M.D. of Provost near Provost and Hayter, Leduc Co. near Warburg Thorsby and Pigeon Lake, Leduc Co. near Calmar and Devon, Brazeau Co. near Drayton Valley and Breton, Co. of Wetaskiwin near Pigeon Lake, Co. of Wetaskiwin near Alder Flats and Winfield, Ponoka Co. near Rimbey Bluffton and Hoadley, Ponoka Co. near Crestomere, Leduc Co. near Leduc Beaumont and Kavanagh, Leduc Co. near New Sarepta and Rolly View, Co. of Wetaskiwin near Wetaskiwin Millet and Hwy 2, Strathcona Co. near Ardrossan and Cooking Lake, Beaver Co. near Tofield, Beaver Co. near Holden and Ryley, Camrose Co. near Hay Lakes and Miquelon Lake Prov.
