Although temperatures will climb towards freezing today, a persistent northeasterly wind off of Hudson Bay will likely keep precipitation as freezing rain through the day. The precipitation will ease through Monday night. Freezing rain accumulations in Churchill could reach as high as 10 to 15 mm.\n\nSouthern areas of the Tadoule Lake region may see freezing rain accumulations of 15 to 25 mm before the area of freezing rain moves north this evening. In the Tadoule Lake townsite, the freezing rain will occur mainly this evening into Tuesday morning with 5 to 10 mm accumulation.\n\nThe extent of freezing rain will be limited in Brochet due to milder temperatures and lighter precipitation. Freezing rain developed over the southeastern corner of the region overnight and will push northwards today  with accumulations of 2 to 5 mm by Tuesday morning.\n\nThe location and intensity of freezing rain will be sensitive to the exact track of this system as well as small changes in temperature. Stay alert for updated bulletins and check the public forecast for additional details on timing.\n\n###\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
