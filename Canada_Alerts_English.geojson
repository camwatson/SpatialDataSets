Mainland arctic outflow winds reaching the eastern coast of Vancouver Island will create the potential for increased snowfall amounts locally.\n\nA third system is on the horizon for Wednesday night and a fair degree of  uncertainty exists regarding its impact upon the south coast.

This will give snowfall to most of the province. Winds may reach or exceed warning criteria over eastern mainland regions and Cape Breton Island Thursday night into Friday.\n\nHigh waves and storm surge may affect the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence and Cape Breton Island on Friday.

It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.

This may give significant snowfall amounts to most of the Island. Winds may reach warning criteria over eastern regions Thursday night into Friday.\n\nHigh waves and storm surge may affect the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence on Friday. This combined with a run of spring tides may cause some coastal flooding and overwash on north facing shorelines of the province, especially in the east.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
