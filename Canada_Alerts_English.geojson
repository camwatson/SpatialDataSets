Temperatures are expected to fall to near the freezing point and therefore there is some uncertainty regarding ice buildup.  Usually ice build up remains minor when temperatures remain near zero. However, caution should always be used when freezing rain is occurring.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.
