				"Summary" : "Description: High concentration of pollutants are expected and will result in poor air quality, especially in urban areas where pollutant emissions are higher.\n\nConcentrations of fine particulate matter will increase again today and may remain high through Sunday.\n\n###\n\nSmog especially affects asthmatic children and people with respiratory ailments or heart disease. It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health. You can also visit the Direction régionale de santé publique du CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l’Île-de-Montréal at www.santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-02-02T15:48:26-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux, the Direction régionale de santé publique du CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l’Île-de-Montréal, the City of Montréal, 2020-02-01T09:49:26-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2040558583.2020<br>Area: Louiseville area, Matawin - Mauricie National Park area, Lac-aux-Sables area, Shawinigan area, Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade area, Trois-Rivières area, Bécancour - Villeroy area, Victoriaville area, Nicolet area, Drummondville area, Granby - Waterloo area, Brome-Missisquoi area, Richmond area, Weedon area, Thetford Mines area, Mont-Orford - Lake Memphrémagog area, Sherbrooke area, Coaticook area, Lac-Mégantic area, Cookshire area",
