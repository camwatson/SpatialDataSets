As temperatures fall below freezing Tuesday evening, snow will combine with strong winds to reduce visibility in blowing snow.  Occasional to frequent whiteout conditions are likely, especially over exposed areas where blowing snow will be more intense.\n\nstrongest wind gusts will occur over the Port au Port Peninsula and south to Channel-Port aux Basques.  Winds will begin to weaken on Wednesday morning.\n\nConditions will begin to improve for some areas on Wednesday afternoon as snow changes to flurries, which will eventually taper off overnight on Wednesday night.\n\nDamage to buildings, such as to roof shingles and windows, may occur.\n\nHigh winds may toss loose objects or cause tree branches to break.\n\n###\n\nVisibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
