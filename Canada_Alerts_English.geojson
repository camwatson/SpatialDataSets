				"Summary" : "Description: At 9:49 p.m. CDT, Environment Canada meteorologists are tracking a severe thunderstorm capable of producing very strong wind gusts, up to nickel size hail and heavy rain.\n\nAt 9:45 pm, radar showed three severe thunderstorms, one south of Manitou near the US border, another just southeast of Portage La Prairie, and a new one just north of Winkler. The thunderstorm that gave nickel sized hail to Elie is now weakening, so any severe thunderstorms should pass to the southwest of Winnipeg. All thunderstorms are tracking east to southeast at 20 to 30 km/h. Golf ball sized hail was reported on the thunderstorm southeast of Portage La Prairie. Localized flooding is also a concern due to the slow motion of these thunderstorms.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Large hail can damage property and cause injury.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2019-08-01T05:34:55-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-08-01T02:50:55-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0613511897.2019<br>Area: Mun. of Pembina incl.
