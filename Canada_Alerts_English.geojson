				"Summary" : "Description: AIR QUALITY ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR VANDERHOOF\n\n(December 2, 2019 - Smithers) The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Northern Health has continued an Air Quality Advisory for Vanderhoof because of high concentrations of fine particulate matter.  This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted.   Staying indoors and in air conditioned spaces helps to reduce fine particulate exposure.  Exposure is particularly a concern for infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-12-03T23:21:33-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

Staying indoors and in air conditioned spaces helps to reduce fine particulate exposure.  Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women and infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease. \n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-12-04T00:02:40-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

Concentrations may increase once again Tuesday evening.\n\n###\n\nSmog especially affects asthmatic children and people with respiratory ailments or heart disease. It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.

Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. If you are experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, follow the advice of your health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce fine particulate exposure.  Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time  air  quality  observations  and  information  regarding  the  health  effects of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-12-03T17:09:15-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
