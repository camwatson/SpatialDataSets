The snow will change to ice pellets Friday evening and to freezing rain overnight for more eastern areas. The precipitation will end as rain showers or drizzle before dawn Saturday. \n\nThe snowfall amounts will depend heavily on how quickly the transition to ice pellets happens.

Elsewhere, the transition will take much longer, resulting in a prolonged period of freezing rain.\n\nPrecipitation is expected to change to rain over all areas by midnight Friday night and will taper off before dawn Saturday.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and extremely hazardous.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
