				"Summary" : "Description: Potential for significant snowfall and strong winds Friday night through Sunday morning.\n\nLocations: along the coast from L'Anse-au-Clair to Hopedale and inland to Upper Lake Melville.\n\nSnowfall totals: possibly 15 to 30 cm.\n\nTime span: beginning Friday night and ending overnight Saturday night or Sunday.\n\nRemarks: Periods of rain, drizzle and snow are expected to continue along the Labrador coast today and Friday. On Friday night, the precipitation will intensify. Generally snow is expected inland while coastal areas of southeastern Labrador may see some mixing with rain. It is too soon to accurately predict snowfall totals but at this time, it appears the heaviest accumulations will occur north of the Straits area.\n\nA snowfall warning has been issued for Postville to Makkovik for a separate system currently affecting the area.\n\nPeak wind gusts: Possibly 90 to 120 km/h.\n\nTime span: Saturday morning to Sunday morning.\n\nRemarks: Winds will strengthen out of the northeast on Friday night and potentially reach warning criteria by early Saturday. Strong wind gusts will continue and gradually shift to northwesterly by Saturday night.  Coastal areas will have the greatest chance of seeing the strongest wind gusts.  Specific locations for strongest gusts will be provided in subsequent forecasts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
