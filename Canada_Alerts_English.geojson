				"Summary" : "Description: A Colorado low will intensify over New England and affect Eastern Quebec Sunday and Monday.\n\nThis storm will bring snow at times heavy, strong to high winds and even rain.\nSnowfall amounts could exceed 15 centimetres over several areas.\nOver the tip of the Gaspé Peninsula and Anticosti Island, precipitation will mainly fall as rain. Rainfall amounts between 20 and 30 millimetres are expected there.\nSoutheasterly winds could gust from 70 to 90 kilometres per hour over the tip of the Gaspé Peninsula and the Lower North Shore on Monday.\n\nThe strong winds combined with the fact that we are currently in a period of high tidal ranges may produce breaking sea conditions at Gaspé-Percé, on Anticosti Island and on the Lower North Shore Monday afternoon.\n\nGiven the complexity of this system, it is still too early to determine the expected amounts of precipitation and the regions that will be the most affected.\n\nMore information on this system's development will be provided as it becomes available.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
