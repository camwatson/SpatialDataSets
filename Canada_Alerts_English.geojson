				"Summary" : "Description: Rain, at times heavy, is expected.\n\nA slow moving disturbance will continue to bring periods of rain to southern Manitoba today and tonight. Moderate to heavy rain developed over southwestern Manitoba early this morning but was beginning to weaken by late morning. This precipitation is expected to reintensify and gradually move to the east-northeast as an upper level disturbance approaches from North Dakota. Since Thursday night a number of areas have already seen 50 to 100 mm of rain in southern Manitoba and a further 40 to 60 mm is possible over the warning area by Sunday morning. Scattered thunderstorms in the area may also produce locally higher amounts. The precipitation is expected to exit the region and move into northwestern Ontario by Sunday morning. \n\nThis rainfall warning may be extended to southeastern areas of the province if conditions warrant.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Localized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
