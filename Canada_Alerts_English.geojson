				"Summary" : "Description: An extreme winter storm will pummel parts of southern Manitoba over the next couple of days. \n\nAn approaching Colorado low will continue to bring heavy wet snow to southern Manitoba tonight. Further snowfall amounts will be 5 to 15 cm by morning, on top of the snow that fell during the day on Thursday. \n\nThe most intense winter storm conditions are expected for Friday and Friday night as the Colorado low draws closer and intensifies. The western half of the Red River Valley may be hit with an extraordinary amount of snow. Snowfall amounts for Friday and Friday night could exceed 50 cm particularly towards the Manitoba escarpment.  Areas closer to the Red River, including the City of Winnipeg, could get between 10 and 25 cm of wet snow. \n\nVery strong winds will accompany this heavy snow on Friday. Gusts of 70 to 80 km/h are forecast throughout southern Manitoba, and gusts over 100 km/h are possible off the Manitoba Lakes. Travelling will become difficult if not impossible as the day wears on, with heavy, accumulating snow, strong winds and temperatures near zero resulting in treacherous conditions. The combination of heavy, wet snow and strong winds will likely result in downed trees and power lines.\n\nThe area of extreme snowfall will shift northward and westward Friday night and into Saturday. It will affect a broad area through Westman and parts of the Interlake. This storm system will weaken through the day on Saturday.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: An extreme winter storm will continue to pummel parts of southern Manitoba over the next couple of days. \n\nThe most intense winter storm conditions are expected for today and tonight for the Red River Valley as a Colorado low draws closer and intensifies. The western half of the Red River Valley may be hit with an extraordinary amount of snow. Snowfall amounts for today and Friday night could exceed 50 cm particularly towards the Manitoba escarpment.  Areas closer to the Red River, including the City of Winnipeg, could get between 10 and 25 cm of wet snow mixed with ice pellets. \n\nVery strong winds will accompany this heavy snow as well. Gusts of 70 to 80 km/h are forecast throughout southern Manitoba, and gusts over 100 km/h are possible off the Manitoba Lakes or in wind prone areas around the Riding Mountains. Travelling will become difficult if not impossible as the day wears on, with heavy, accumulating snow, strong winds and temperatures near zero resulting in treacherous conditions. The combination of heavy, wet snow and strong winds will likely result in downed trees and power lines.\n\nThe area of extreme snowfall will shift northward and westward tonight into Saturday and begin affecting a broader area through Westman and parts of the Interlake. This storm system will gradually weaken through the day on Saturday.\n\n###\n\nRoad closures are possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-10-12T07:01:42-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-10-11T15:02:42-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0397977534.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Wallace-Woodworth incl.

				"Summary" : "Description: Rain, at times heavy, continues. The ground, already near saturation, has little ability to absorb further rainfall.\n\nRain (or at times wet snow) will continue in southeastern Manitoba today.\n\nBands of precipitation will continue to move through the area today and a further 5 to 15 mm should be expected. Locally higher amounts are also possible as isolated thunderstorms move through the area.\n\nRecent heavy rains in southeastern Manitoba have resulted in saturated ground and localized flooding, which will be made worse with the current storm system.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-10-12T05:39:07-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-10-11T13:40:07-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3555502888.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Lac Du Bonnet, L.G. of Pinawa incl.
