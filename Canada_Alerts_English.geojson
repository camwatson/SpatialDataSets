There are also a few fires to west and southwest of Sandy Lake. Forecast winds are expected from the northwest today which will drift the smoke to the south and southeast. \n\nThese smoke plumes will continue to affect the region. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-06T05:07:22-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-05T13:08:22-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3567571347.2019<br>Area: Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake, Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell, Pickle Lake - Cat Lake, Red Lake - Woodland Caribou Park, Ear Falls - Perrault Falls - Western Lac Seul, Kenora - Grassy Narrows - Whitedog",

Forecast winds are expected to shift from west to northwest today. \n\nThese smoke plumes will continue to affect the region. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-06T00:59:06-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-05T09:28:06-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2192178082.2019<br>Area: Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake, Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell",

As a result, conditions will feel particularly uncomfortable in these areas.\n\nDuring times of high heat, your health or your family and neighbours' health can deteriorate rapidly.\n\nThe Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux du Québec, in cooperation with Environment and Climate Change Canada, recommends that you protect yourself from heat effects by taking the following actions:\n\nDrink 6 to 8 glasses of water per day. Follow your physician's instructions regarding the amount of fluid to drink;\nAvoid alcoholic beverages;\nSpend at least 2 hours a day in air conditioned or cool places;\nTake at least one shower or cool bath per day, or cool your skin several times per day with wet towels;\nLimit physical activities;\nWear light clothes.\n\nBe sure to:\nNever leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle or a closed room, even for a few minutes;\nCheck on your loved ones, especially those vulnerable or living alone.\n\nIf you have questions regarding your health condition, call Info-Santé at 8-1-1 or ask a health care provider. In case of an emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\nFor more information, visit the Government of Quebec's Portail sante mieux-etre at www.sante.gouv.qc.ca/en/.\n\n###\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to QCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #QCStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-07-06T07:16:00-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-05T15:17:00-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1687410654.2019<br>Area: Longueuil - Varennes area, Laval area, Montréal Island area, Châteauguay - La Prairie area",

A few thunderstorms developing along the US border near noon will move northward during the afternoon. There is the potential of an isolated severe thunderstorm giving rainfall amounts up to 20 mm, 2 cm hail and wind gusts to 70 km/h.\n\n###\n\nIntense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

These thunderstorms will have the potential to produce a few cold core funnel clouds early in their life cycle.  The threat for funnel clouds will dissipate early this evening as thunderstorms weaken with the loss of daytime heating.\n\n###\n\nThese types of funnel clouds are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing large hail and heavy rain.\n\nAn upper low pressure system over Vancouver Island will result in a southerly flow of moist, unstable air over the southern interior today. A few thunderstorms developing along the US border near noon will move northward during the afternoon. There is the potential of an isolated severe thunderstorm giving rainfall amounts up to 20 mm, 2 cm hail and wind gusts to 70 km/h.\n\n###\n\nIntense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
