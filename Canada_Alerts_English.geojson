These snow squalls have the potential to produce 15 cm in 12 hours.  \n\nCurrent indications suggest that the snow squalls could affect shoreline areas from Toronto Island to Burlington as well as areas inland.\n\nMotorists should be prepared for possible winter driving conditions, especially along the QEW and portions of highway 403 and 407 on Thursday.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
