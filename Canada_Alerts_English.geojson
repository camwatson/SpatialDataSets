				"Summary" : "Description: The South Okanagan region is being impacted or is likely to be impacted by wildfire smoke over the next 24-48 hours. Local smoke is anticipated from the Eagle Bluffs wildfire.\n\nDuring a wildfire, smoke conditions can change quickly over short distances and can vary considerably hour-by-hour. \n\nWildfire smoke is a natural part of our environment but it is  important to be mindful that exposure to smoke may affect your health.\n\nPeople with pre-existing health conditions, the elderly, pregnant women and  infants,  children,  and  sensitive individuals are more likely to experience health effects from smoke exposure.\n\nThe bulletin can be accessed online at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/\nair/air-quality/air-advisories.\n\nThe next bulletin update will be available August 14, 2019.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-08-15T02:40:14-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
