As appropriate, follow your physician's instructions regarding the amount of fluid to drink;\nAvoid alcoholic beverages;\nIf you can, spend at least 2 hours a day in an air conditioned or cool place;\nTake at least one cool shower or bath per day, or cool your skin several times per day with wet towels;\nLimit physical activities;\nWear light clothes.\n\nBe sure to:\nNever leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle or a poorly ventilated room, even for a few minutes;\nCheck on your loved ones, especially those who are vulnerable or living alone.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding your health, call Info-Santé by dialing 8-1-1 or ask a health care provider. In case of emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\nFor more information, visit the Government of Quebec's Portail santé mieux-être at www.sante.gouv.qc.ca.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Smoke is expected or occurring.\n\nHigh levels of air pollution are expected today due to smoke from forest fires.\nThe smoke plumes from forest fires in the Chute-des-Passes area may affect neighbouring regions. Air quality could deteriorate should the smoke go down to ground level.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nIf your home is not air-conditioned, be sure the house doesn't get too warm when doors and windows are closed to keep out smoke. Exposure to too much heat can also result in illness.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-06-24T01:01:14-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-23T09:02:14-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0682423359.2020<br>Area: Manic-5 area, Manic-3 area, Chutes-des-Passes - Pipmuacan Reservoir area, Labrieville area",
