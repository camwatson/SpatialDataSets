				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA system approaching from Alberta will spread snow and at times freezing rain into northern Saskatchewan starting this morning. The precipitation will gradually ease and move out of the region late tonight and into early Thursday morning. Snowfall accumulations between 10 and 20 cm are expected.  5 mm of ice build-up is possible in southern sections due to freezing rain.  \n\nAs the system intensifies, gusty winds will generate blowing snow at times in open areas.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and hazardous.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Strong winds with severe and damaging gusts are expected or occurring.\n\nStrong west to northwest winds, with gusts of 110 km/h, this afternoon and tonight.\n\nStrong winds will move into Saskatchewan this afternoon and move eastward across the southern half of the province.  Gusts as high as 110 km/h will occur.\n\nA strong low pressure system will track across Saskatchewan today. Over southwestern sections, severe winds will develop toward noon and expand eastward throughout the day. In addition, mild temperatures and scattered rain showers through the day will give way to flurries and possibly snow squalls tonight. With the ongoing high winds, periods of sudden, near zero visibilities in snow and blowing snow may occur. Additional warnings may be required should these conditions develop.\n\nThe strong winds will subside below warning criteria by Thursday morning, but will remain blustery through the remainder of Thursday.\n\n###\n\nDamage to buildings, such as to roof shingles and windows, may occur. Drivers may lose control of their vehicles; tall vehicles are at risk of being overturned.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
