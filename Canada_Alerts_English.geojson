				"Summary" : "Description: Messy mix of wintry precipitation including a possible period of freezing rain. \n\nPrecipitation is forecast to begin as showers Wednesday morning across the area. However, by Wednesday afternoon sharply falling temperatures will allow a wintry mix of precipitation to develop. Snow and ice pellets are likely, followed by a period of freezing rain Wednesday evening into Wednesday night. AT this point in time, combined snow and ice pellet amounts of 10 to 15 cm appear possible, as well as light accretions of freezing rain.\n\nPrecipitation is forecast to come to an end from west to east on Thursday. \n\nGiven the expected messy mix of wintry precipitation, travel will be impacted across the area. Also ice accretions of freezing rain may also cause some power outages.\n\nResidents are advised to monitor future forecasts closely.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation,  chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider.

Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice. \n\nExposure  is  particularly  a  concern  for  individuals  with  chronic  conditions  such  as asthma, COPD, heart disease, and diabetes, respiratory infections such as COVID-19, pregnant women, infants, and older adults.  Persons with chronic underlying medicalc onditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Where appropriate, maintain physical distancing. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce particulate matter exposure.\n\nThe City of Prince George’s Clean Air Bylaw prohibits all open burning, including backyard burning, and land clearing burning.  During air quality advisories, this bylaw also prohibits recreational fires, use of wood-burning appliances (except for sole wood burning heat users), and street sweeping activities (unless approved by an Authorized Person). Industry is required to follow permit requirements that are triggered during air quality advisories and are asked to reduce emissions wherever possible.\n\nReal-time  air  quality  observations  and  information  regarding  the  health  effects  of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-03-10T18:15:08-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
