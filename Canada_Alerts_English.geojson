				"Summary" : "Description: ROAD DUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR BURNS LAKE AND SMITHERS\n\n(March 16, 2020 - Smithers) The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Northern Health has issued a Road Dust Advisory for Burns Lake because of high concentrations of coarse particulate matter that are expected to persist until there is precipitation or dust suppression.  Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted.  Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at  https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-03-18T08:30:51-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

				"Summary" : "Description: ROAD DUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR BURNS LAKE AND SMITHERS\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Northern Health has continued a Road Dust Advisory for Burns Lake and Smithers because of high concentrations of coarse particulate matter that are expected to persist until there is precipitation or dust suppression.  Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted.  Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at  https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-03-18T20:11:35-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
