				"Summary" : "Description: For Tropical Depression Six.\n\nThe next information statement will be issued by 03:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nTropical Depression Six expected to become Tropical Storm Erin tonight or early on Wednesday. Erin is then expected to begin tracking northeastward toward Atlantic Canada on Wednesday, likely bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to parts of the Maritimes later Thursday or Friday. \n\n1. Summary of basic information at 03:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: Near 31.6 North 71.7 West.\n\nAbout distance 542 kilometres southeast of Cape Hatteras NC.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 56 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: Northwest at 7 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 1009 millibars.\n\n2. Public weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nWith Tropical Depression Six still over 1500 km and several days away from the region, details on impacts for Atlantic Canada can only be generalised at this time. Most of the impacts will depend greatly on the exact track the system takes through our region, which at this time is expected to be near the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia on Friday before moving into Newfoundland Friday night.\n\na. Wind.\n\nStrong and gusty winds will likely accompany the system, especially to the right of and near the eventual track it takes through our region. At this time it is unlikely that winds will reach warning criteria in the region (i.e. gusts to 90 km/h or higher), but could still be strong enough to cause isolated power outages and minor damage, especially given that trees are still in full leaf.\n\nb. Rainfall.\n\nGiven the current forecast track, the greatest impact from this system will be rainfall, which could meet or exceed warning criteria (50 mm or more in 24 hours) in parts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and possibly southeastern New Brunswick. Maximum rainfall could locally exceed 100 mm in some isolated parts of these regions. Details will become more clear in the coming days as the system becomes better defined and draws nearer to our region.\n\nc. Surge/Waves.\n\nAt this time, given the expected intensity and track of the system, significant storm surge and coastal impacts from high waves are not very likely over the Maritimes. However, some higher than normal water levels and high surf are possible near and to the right of the track, and this will be monitored closely as the system evolves over the coming days. \n\n3. Marine weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nGale warnings will likely be required for waters near and adjacent to the track Erin takes through our region later on Thursday and Friday.  Based on the current forecast intensity, storm force winds are not expected at this time.\n\nForecaster(s): Mercer/Borgel\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-08-28T23:37:50-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-08-27T17:38:50-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2965638156.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Kouchibouguac National Park, Fundy National Park, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I.",

				"Summary" : "Description: For Tropical Depression Six.\n\nThe next information statement will be issued by 03:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nTropical Depression Six expected to become Tropical Storm Erin later today or tonight. Erin is then expected to begin tracking northeastward toward Atlantic Canada on Wednesday, likely bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to parts of the Maritimes later Thursday or Friday. \n\n1. Summary of basic information at 09:00 a.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: Near 31.2 North 71.7 West.\n\nAbout distance 575 kilometres southeast of Cape Hatteras NC.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 55 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: Southeast at 4 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 1010 millibars.\n\n2. Public weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nWith Tropical Depression Six still over 1500 km and several days away from the region, details on impacts for Atlantic Canada can only be generalised at this time. Most of the impacts will depend greatly on the exact track the system takes through our region, which at this time is expected to be near the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia Friday afternoon.\n\na. Wind.\n\nStrong and gusty winds will likely accompany the system, especially to the right of and near the eventual track it takes through our region. At this time it is unlikely that winds will reach warning criteria in the region (i.e. gusts to 90 km/h or higher), but could still be strong enough to cause isolated power outages and minor damage, especially given trees are still in full leaf.\n\nb. Rainfall.\n\nGiven the current forecast track, the greatest impact from this system will be rainfall, which could meet or exceed warning criteria (50 mm or more in 24 hours) in many parts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and southeastern New Brunswick. Maximum rainfall could locally exceed 100 mm in some isolated parts of these regions. Details will become more clear in the coming days as the system becomes better defined and draws nearer to our region.\n\nc. Surge/Waves.\n\nAt this time, given the expected intensity and track of the system, significant storm surge and coastal impacts from high waves are not very likely. However, some higher than normal water levels and high surf are possible near and to the right of the track, and this will be monitored closely as the system evolves over the coming days. \n\n3. Marine weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nGale warnings will likely be required for waters near and adjacent to the track Erin takes through our region later on Thursday and Friday.  Based on the current forecast intensity, storm force winds are not expected at this time.\n\nForecaster(s): Mercer/Borgel\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-08-28T17:38:16-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-08-27T11:39:16-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0908965725.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Fundy National Park, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I.",
