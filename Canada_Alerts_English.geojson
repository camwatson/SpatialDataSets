While it is too soon to determine exactly where the heaviest accumulations will occur, the potential exists for significant amounts over some locations. The snow may also change to rain over southern coastal areas before ending.\n\nGusty easterly winds accompanying the snow will result in blowing snow and reduced visibilities.\n\nConditions are expected to improve over southern and western Newfoundland on Sunday afternoon, and elsewhere Sunday night.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
