				"Summary" : "Description: For Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThe next information statement will be issued by 3:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nHurricane Dorian will move into Atlantic Canada and extreme Eastern Quebec this weekend as either a Category One Hurricane or a strong Tropical Storm.\n\nCurrently Dorian is a Category Two system and is still near the coast of Florida. It will move up along the Eastern Seaboard to Cape Hatteras on Friday, then will get caught up in a westerly flow and will move near Nova Scotia on Saturday and will probably move over Newfoundland on Sunday. When it moves into Atlantic waters it may still be a Category One Hurricane, but is expected to diminish to a Tropical Storm as it moves though our region.\n\nPossible Impacts:\n\nA. Public \n\nRainfall will be significant, especially north and west of Dorian's track. This suggests highest rainfall amounts are likely for the southern Maritimes and parts of Newfoundland, but some rain is likely over most regions. Most regions will see some tropical storm force winds, and south of the forecast track winds may reach hurricane force. Wind impacts may be enhanced by foliage on the trees, and may cause power outages. There will also be some rough and pounding surf, especially for parts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.\n\nB. Marine\n\nAs Hurricane Dorian moves into our waters, there is a reasonable chance of hurricane force winds near and south of the track, mainly over the southern Atlantic forecast waters. There will also be large waves, again mainly over southern waters.\n\n\nForecasters: McArthur, Mercer.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-09-05T17:39:41-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-09-04T11:40:41-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0613377905.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Fredericton and Southern York County, Oromocto and Sunbury County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Stanley - Doaktown - Blackville Area, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Kouchibouguac National Park, Fundy National Park, Miramichi and area, Acadian Peninsula, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I., Avalon Peninsula North, Avalon Peninsula Southeast, St. John's and vicinity, Avalon Peninsula Southwest, Burin Peninsula, Connaigre, Burgeo - Ramea, Channel-Port aux Basques and vicinity, Corner Brook and vicinity, Deer Lake - Humber Valley, Gros Morne, Bay St. George, Buchans and the interior, Grand Falls-Windsor and vicinity, Bay of Exploits, Bonavista North, Bonavista Peninsula, Clarenville and vicinity, Gander and vicinity, Green Bay - White Bay, Terra Nova, Northern Peninsula East, Parson's Pond - Hawke's Bay, Port Saunders and the Straits, Red Bay to L'Anse-au-Clair, Norman Bay to Lodge Bay, Cartwright to Black Tickle, Eagle River, Chevery, Blanc-Sablon, Anticosti, Îles-de-la-Madeleine",
