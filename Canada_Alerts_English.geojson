				"Summary" : "Description: As of early this morning much of southern Manitoba remains under a winter storm warning as a massive low pressure system continues to relentlessly pummel the area with heavy snow and strong winds.  Widespread snowfall accumulations of 40-60 cm have been reported in much of western Manitoba and the western Red River Valley and many highways remain closed.  Widespread power outages continue to plague the region with significant numbers of downed or damaged trees.\n\nThe low pressure system will remain more or less stationary and hence snowfall and strong winds will continue, with further accumulations ranging from 5 to 15 cm over the course of the day. The snow will continue to be accompanied by winds gusting as high as 60 km/h giving near-zero visibility at times in blowing snow.\n\nTravelling will remain difficult if not impossible today as the heavy accumulating snow, strong winds, and temperatures near zero will result in treacherous conditions. Further downed trees and power outages are to be expected.\n\nThe storm will begin to weaken tonight, although a few areas will still see another 5 cm or so accumulation by Sunday morning.\n\nThe winter storm warning has been ended for Winnipeg as the worst of the system has now pushed west of the city.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: As of early this morning much of southern Manitoba remains under a winter storm warning as a massive low pressure system continues to relentlessly pummel the area with heavy snow and strong winds.  Widespread snowfall accumulations of 40-60 cm have been reported in much of western Manitoba and the western Red River Valley and many highways remain closed.  Widespread power outages continue to plague the region with significant numbers of downed or damaged trees.\n\nThe low pressure system will remain more or less stationary and hence snowfall and strong winds will continue, with further accumulations ranging from 5 to 15 cm over the course of the day. The snow will continue to be accompanied by winds gusting as high as 60 km/h giving near-zero visibility at times in blowing snow.\n\nTravelling will remain difficult if not impossible today as the heavy accumulating snow, strong winds, and temperatures near zero will result in treacherous conditions. Further downed trees and power outages are to be expected.\n\nThe storm will begin to weaken tonight, although a few areas will still see another 5 cm or so accumulation by Sunday morning.\n\nThe winter storm warning has been ended for Winnipeg as the worst of the system has now pushed west of the city.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-10-13T01:52:09-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-10-12T09:53:09-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0494652795.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Wallace-Woodworth incl.

				"Summary" : "Description: As of late this morning the western Parklands and Interlake remain under a winter storm warning as a massive low pressure system continues to relentlessly pummel the area with heavy snow and strong winds. \n\nThe low pressure system will remain more or less stationary and hence snowfall and strong winds will continue, with further accumulations ranging from 5 to 15 cm over the course of the day. The snow will continue to be accompanied by winds gusting as high as 60 km/h giving near-zero visibility at times in blowing snow.\n\nElsewhere, widespread snowfall accumulations of 40-60 cm have been reported in much of western Manitoba and the western Red River Valley and many highways remain closed.  Widespread power outages continue to plague the region with significant numbers of downed or damaged trees. However, accumulating snowfall has now ended for the entire Red River Valley and areas westward to Brandon.\n\nTravelling will remain difficult if not impossible today as the heavy accumulating snow, strong winds, and temperatures near zero will result in treacherous conditions. Further downed trees and power outages are to be expected.\n\nThe storm will begin to weaken tonight, although a few areas will still see another 5 cm or so accumulation by Sunday morning.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-10-13T01:59:54-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-10-12T15:19:54-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3812977693.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Wallace-Woodworth incl.
