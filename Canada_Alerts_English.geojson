This rain is then expected to continue through Thursday night. Total rainfall amounts of 30 to 50 mm are likely with this event. \n\nBy Friday morning, Christmas Day, the rain is expected change to scattered flurries or periods of snow as temperatures drop to below the freezing mark. A few centimetres of snow will be possible.\n\nThis rain is associated with a strong low pressure system that will approach the area from the south Thursday. There remains some uncertainty as to the exact track of this low pressure system. Areas closer to and including Central Ontario may transition to snow earlier than currently forecast, changing associated precipitation amounts.\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is a possible as the frozen ground has a reduced ability to absorb rainfall. \n\nRainfall Warnings may be required as the event draws closer.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

These areas may receive a few centimeters of snow this morning followed by rain showers this afternoon. Early Thursday morning, the rain showers will transition to snow and taper to flurries Thursday afternoon. A total snowfall amount of up to 5 cm is possible for these areas on Thursday.\n\nConsider post-poning non essential travel in the northern areas until conditions improve.
