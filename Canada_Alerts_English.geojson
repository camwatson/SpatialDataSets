Total snowfall amounts of 15 to 20 cm are expected by the time the snow moves out of the area Tuesday morning. \n\nDriving conditions will quickly deteriorate after the snow arrives this evening.  Motorists should be prepared to adjust their travel plans accordingly.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
