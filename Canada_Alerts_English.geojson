				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility over much of the province. \n\nThe thickest smoke currently extends across northern Alberta then east and southeastward towards Medicine Hat. Gradual improvement is expected overnight tonight and into through Sunday for most of east central and southern Alberta.\n\nNorthern Alberta will remain in areas of smoke this weekend.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-06-02T19:23:12-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-06-02T03:24:12-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1012917098.2019<br>Area: City of Lloydminster, Kneehill Co. near Torrington and Wimborne, Kneehill Co. near Trochu and Huxley, Kneehill Co. near Three Hills, Kneehill Co. near Acme and Linden, Kneehill Co. near Carbon, Starland Co. near Rumsey and Rowley, Starland Co. near Morrin and Munson, Starland Co. near Michichi and Delia, Wheatland Co. near Rockyford and Rosebud, Wheatland Co. near Hwys 569 and 848, Town of Drumheller, Rocky View Co. near Irricana Beiseker and Kathyrn, S.A. 2 near Finnegan and Little Fish Lake Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoky Skies Bulletin - June 1, 2019\n\nSeveral regions of BC are being impacted or are likely to be impacted by wildfire smoke over the next 24-48 hours. The next bulletin update will be available June 02, 2019.\n\nThe bulletin can be accessed online at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/ air/air-quality/air-advisories\n\nBe informed:\n\n- During a wildfire, smoke conditions can change quickly over short distances and can vary considerably hour-by-hour.\n\n- Wildfire smoke is a natural part of our environment but it is important to be mindful that exposure to smoke may affect your health.\n\n- People with pre-existing health conditions, the elderly, infants, children and sensitive individuals are more likely to experience health effects from smoke exposure.\n\n\nDuring smoky conditions:\n\nFollow your common sense\n- Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes difficult or you feel unwell.\n- Stay cool and drink plenty of fluids.\n-\tCarry any rescue medications with you at all times.\n-\tMake sure that children and others who cannot care for themselves follow the same advice.\n\nMonitor your symptoms\nDifferent people have different responses to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears.\n\n- People with asthma or other chronic illness should activate the personal care plans they have designed with their family physicians.\n-\tIf you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC at 8-1-1.\n-\tIf you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your health care provider, walk-in clinic, or emergency department. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\n\nTips to reduce your exposure:\n- Smoke levels may be lower indoors but will still be elevated, so stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.\n-\tRunning a commercially available HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter can improve indoor air quality in the room where the device is located.\n-\tIf you have a forced air heating/cooling system in your home, it may help to change the filter and set the fan to run continuously.\n-\tReduce indoor air pollution sources such as smoking, burning incense, and frying foods.\n-\tConsider going to a library, community center, or shopping mall with cooler filtered air to get some relief from the smoke.\n- If travelling in a car with air conditioning, keep the windows up and the ventilation set to recirculate.\n- If you are very sensitive to smoke, consider moving to another location with cleaner air, but be aware that conditions can change rapidly.\n-\tMaintaining good overall health is a good way to prevent health effects resulting from short-term exposure to air pollution.\n\nMore information\nFor general information about wildfire smoke and your health, contact HealthLink BC:\n- Phone 8-1-1 (toll free, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week), or\nCheck the Wildfires and Your Health webpage at https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-feature/wildfires.\n- The current Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and other air quality information is available at the BC Air Quality website, http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/bcairquality/readings/aqhi-table.xml.\n-\tForecasts of smoke levels over the next 48 hours are available from the Environment and Climate Change Canada FireWork prediction system, https://weather.gc.ca/firework/index_e.html.\n-\tIf you need to work outdoors in smoky conditions, material can be found at the WorkSafe BC Wildfire FAQ website, https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/ health-safety/information-sheets/wildfire-smoke-frequently-asked-questions-faq.\n-\tFirst Nations Health Authority: http://www.fnha.ca/what-we-do/environmental-health/ wildfire-information\n-\tInterior Health Authority: For resources related to forest fire smoke exposure, air quality, food safety when the power is out and ensuring your drinking water is safe visit http://www.interiorhealth.ca (Environment Tab/Emergency Information).\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-06-02T12:56:25-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

				"Summary" : "Description: Significant rainfall with heavy downpours is expected for Nova Scotia on Sunday and into Sunday night.\n\nAn intensifying low pressure system southwest of Nova Scotia will move northeastward toward the Maritimes tonight and Sunday, then track across the region on Sunday night.\n\nRain at times heavy and a risk of thundershowers are forecast to move into southwestern areas of Nova Scotia early Sunday morning. The rain is expected to spread northeastward to reach Cape Breton by noon and then taper to scattered showers on Sunday night. \n\nRainfall amounts of 30 to 45 millimetres are currently forecast for Atlantic coastal regions of mainland Nova Scotia, but there is still some uncertainty in the track of the low. Should the heaviest rain associated with this system move further inland or remain further offshore than expected, total rainfall amounts may increase or decrease in future forecasts. It is possible that accumulations will reach or exceed warning criteria of 50 millimetres in 24 hours in some areas.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Rainfall with heavy downpours is expected along much of the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia today.\n\nA low pressure system southwest of Nova Scotia will move northward to cross the Maritimes tonight. Rain at times heavy and a risk of thundershowers are forecast to spread northeastward to reach Cape Breton near noon today and then taper to scattered showers tonight. \nRainfall amounts up to 45 millimetres are currently forecast for some regions along the Atlantic coast. \n\nThere is still considerable uncertainty associated with this system.  Recent forecast guidance has shifted the predicted area of heaviest rain to the southeast, and forecast rainfall amounts have been decreased for southwestern Nova Scotia. It is still possible that some areas of the province may receive amounts in excess of the rainfall warning criteria of 50 millimetres in 24 hours.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility over much of the province. \n\nThe thickest smoke currently extends from northwestern Alberta southeastward towards Medicine Hat. Gradual improvement is expected overnight through Sunday for most of central and southern Alberta.\n\nNorthern Alberta will remain in areas of smoke this weekend.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-06-02T13:32:00-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-06-01T21:33:00-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2122409077.2019<br>Area: City of Lloydminster, Lacombe Co. near Eckville, Lacombe Co. near Lacombe Blackfalds and Bentley, Lacombe Co. near Clive Alix and Mirror, Red Deer Co. near Sylvan Lake and Stephansson House, Red Deer Co. near Spruce View and Red Lodge Prov.
