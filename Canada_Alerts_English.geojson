Snow is expected to spread across the northeast coast Thursday evening, accompanied by strong winds and areas of blowing snow. Conditions will improve by Friday afternoon.\n\nThere is still uncertainty regarding the track of this storm, which will have a significant impact on snowfall amounts. Should the storm pass further east, snowfall amounts will be much less, while if it tracks closer to the island, higher accumulations will be expected.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
