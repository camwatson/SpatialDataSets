Accumulations of up to 30 centimetres are forecast, although locally greater amounts are possible over the highest terrain.\n\nWet snow with lesser accumulations near 5 to 10 centimetres is expected over lower elevations, since temperatures are forecast to remain slightly above freezing.\n\nStrong westerly winds will combine with the snow to give poor visibility at times over the higher terrain this afternoon and evening. Motorists are advised to prepare for winter driving conditions.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Rapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult.\n\nSnowfall warnings are issued when significant snowfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
