Rain ahead of this system will begin this evening and become heavy at times tonight. Temperatures will also rise to above 10 degrees on Tuesday contributing to significant or total melting of the snow pack. Total rainfall amounts of 40 to 60 mm are expected by Wednesday evening, however higher amounts are possible if several heavy rain bands move over the same area in succession.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.
