				"Summary" : "Description: Possible high levels of air pollution due to smoke from forest fires are expected tonight and Tuesday. \n\nSmoke plumes from numerous forest fires in the region are moving over the area. Forecast winds are expected to remain light out of the west or southwest tonight. These smoke plumes may affect the region for a few days. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nIn general, wearing a mask is not the best way to protect your health during a smoke event. In fact, masks may lead to a false sense of security, which may encourage increased physical activity and time spent outdoors, meaning increased exposure to smoke. They can also make breathing more difficult.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-02T21:50:17-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-02T05:51:17-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1884570094.2019<br>Area: Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake",

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing damaging wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nAs a cold front continues to traverse Saskatchewan this evening, thunderstorms continue to develop along the front. For much of southeastern Saskatchewan, some of the thunderstorms that develop have the potential to become severe.\n\nThe cold front is tracking rapidly across Saskatchewan, so the weather may change quickly. Stay alert for updated bulletins as the watch area may be extended early this evening.\n\nAlso of note, this cold front will bring a change in weather conditions as it pulls down cooler air from the arctic. Expect gusty northwesterly winds and cooler temperatures behind the cold front. Cooler temperatures will persist for the next few days.\n\n###\n\nVery strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to SKstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #SKStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-07-02T07:59:56-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-02T01:55:56-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2183316791.2019<br>Area: R.M. of McKillop including Strasbourg and Rowans Ravine Prov.
