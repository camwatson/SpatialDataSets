There is also the potential for a line of thunderstorms to develop which could result in gusts as high as 90 km/h.\n\n###\n\nStrong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles.\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
