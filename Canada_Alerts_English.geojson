Strong northwesterly winds gusting up to 60 km/h will also occur this afternoon.

				"Summary" : "Description: Local snow squalls possible this afternoon through tonight.\n\nA few heavy flurries are possible this morning. However, by this afternoon, locally heavy snow squalls are expected to develop with the arrival of an unseasonably cold airmass. \n\nLocally heavy snowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm are expected by the time the snow squalls weaken tonight.\n\nThe heavy snow will combine with strong northwesterly winds gusting up to 80 km/h resulting in reduced visibilities in heavy snow and blowing snow at times.\n\nMotorists should be prepared for adverse winter driving conditions and adjust their travel plans accordingly.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
