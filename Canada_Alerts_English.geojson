Very strong wind gusts are the main threat with these thunderstorms, as well as marginally severe hail.\n\n###\n\nVery strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
