Snow is expected to begin early Monday morning for southern portions of the island, and will begin mid-morning for more northern regions. There is potential for the snow to mix with or change over to rain or ice pellets over southern portions of the Avalon Monday afternoon.\n\nStrong northeasterly winds followed by strong northwesterlies are also expected Monday and Monday night. Maximum gusts are most likely going to range between 60 and 80 km/h for most areas. Along the south and east coasts, there is a possibility gusts could reach 100 km/h. These strong winds will combine with snow to reduce visibility in blowing snow.\n\nConditions will improve on Tuesday morning.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nWinter storm watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls likely beginning Sunday afternoon.\n\nLocally heavy snow squalls are forecast to develop once again Sunday afternoon as strong westerly winds become established. These snow squalls are then expected to continue into Sunday night before weakening on Monday.\n\nAt this point in time, very heavy snowfall amounts in the 15 to 40 cm range appear possible, with the heaviest amounts likely in the Midland to Orillia to Port Carling areas. \n\nWinds once again are expected to gust up to 50 km/h, resulting in blowing snow and significantly reduced visibilities at times. Given this, travel is expected to be hazardous, and travellers are advised to adjust their travel plans accordingly as the snow squall event draws nearer.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

This will generate onshore flurries and local snow squalls Monday night and Tuesday.\n\nStrong northwesterly winds are also expected Monday night and Tuesday. Maximum gusts are most likely going to range between 60 and 80 km/h for most areas. For the Port aux Basques area, there is a possibility gusts could reach 100 km/h.

Strong northeasterly winds will develop Sunday evening and persist into Monday morning giving near-zero visibilities at times in blowing and drifting snow. Snow will gradually end from west to east across the province beginning early Monday morning but strong northerly winds will continue to give blowing snow over the eastern half of the province until Monday afternoon.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult. Poor weather conditions may contribute to transportation delays.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
