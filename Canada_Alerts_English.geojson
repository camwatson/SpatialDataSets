				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls are occurring. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nSnow squalls have developed over Great Slave Lake. Localized snowfall amounts near 15 cm are expected under these squalls today. Snow squalls will come to an end this evening.\n\n###\n\nSnow squall warnings are issued when bands of snow form that produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to NTstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #NTStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-11-04T01:59:11-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-11-03T16:49:11-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0819251915.2019<br>Area: Ft.
