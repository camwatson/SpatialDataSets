				"Summary" : "Description: For Hurricane Epsilon.\n\nSummary of basic information at 9:30 p.m. NDT.\n\nLocation: Near 40.1 North 57.6 West.\n\nAbout 815 kilometres south-southwest of Cape Race.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 130 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: Northeast at 35 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 958 millibars.\n\nHurricane Epsilon will skirt the southern extremes of the southern Grand banks on Sunday and then move rapidly away from Atlantic Canadian waters Sunday night. Epsilon will not have any direct impacts on Canadian land areas. However, swell waves are expected to build along the southern coastlines of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland tonight and Sunday. The largest waves reaching the coast are expected over the southern Avalon Peninsula where waves of 4 to 6 metres are expected. Over the south coast of Newfoundland from the Burin Peninsula and west to Port aux Basques, waves of 3 to 5 metres are expected. Along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, waves of 3 to 4 metres are likely. Rain from a developing trough of low pressure well ahead of Epsilon is spreading over southeastern Newfoundland this evening, but the center of Epsilon will track well offshore near the southeastern corner of the Grand Banks early on Sunday.\n\nGale to storm force winds are expected over southeastern offshore waters. Over the southern edge of the Southeastern Grand Banks, hurricane force winds will likely occur. Waves over the southeastern offshore waters are expected to be generally 6 to 9 metres except over the southern edges of the southern Grand Banks where waves of 10 to 13 metres are expected.\n\nThis is the last scheduled bulletin from the CHC on Hurricane Epsilon.\n\n\nForecaster(s): Hatt\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-10-26T02:35:08-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-10-24T23:26:08-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3960530919.2020<br>Area: Avalon Peninsula Southeast",
