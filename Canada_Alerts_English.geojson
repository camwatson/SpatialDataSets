				"Summary" : "Description: A Pacific low is forecast to move through central BC tonight and track across south-central Alberta Friday. \n\nIn south-central Alberta, a band of snow associated with this weather system will likely produce accumulations up to 10 cm by Friday afternoon, with higher amounts along the foothills and in the mountain parks. There remains considerable uncertainty as to where the majority of the snow will fall as this low is still off the BC Pacific coast. \n\nIn southern Alberta, temperatures across the region are expected to initially be well above zero on Friday allowing for possible showers to occur ahead of the snow. As the cold front passes through the region Friday afternoon, temperatures are expected to rapidly fall below zero with snow and strong northerly winds with gusts of 60 to 80 km/h. This abrupt change in weather may lead to hazardous travel conditions, and may occur during the Friday afternoon commute for some southern Alberta communities.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A Pacific low is forecast to move through central BC tonight and track across south-central Alberta Friday. \n\nIn south-central Alberta, a band of snow associated with this weather system will likely produce accumulations up to 10 cm by Friday afternoon, with higher amounts along the foothills and in the mountain parks. There remains considerable uncertainty as to where the majority of the snow will fall as this low is still off the BC Pacific coast. \n\nIn southern Alberta, temperatures across the region are expected to initially be well above zero on Friday allowing for possible showers to occur ahead of the snow. As the cold front passes through the region Friday afternoon, temperatures are expected to rapidly fall below zero with snow and strong northerly winds with gusts of 60 to 80 km/h. This abrupt change in weather may lead to hazardous travel conditions, and may occur during the Friday afternoon commute for some southern Alberta communities.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
