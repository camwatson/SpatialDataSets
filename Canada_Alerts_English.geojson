				"Summary" : "Description: Brief, intense snowfall is expected to develop. Under the snow squall, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow.\n\nBrief squalls of snow and wind are expected over southern Saskatchewan.\n\nSnow squalls, with brief near-zero visibilites in snow and blowing snow, will form in parts of southern Saskatchewan this evening and tonight. While a squall may only last less than an hour, whiteout conditions are likely with any squall that does occur.\n\nThe potential for snow squalls will end overnight.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for brief but intense bursts of heavy snow producing near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
