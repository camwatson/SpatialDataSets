These blizzard conditions will gradually improve Friday evening. \n\nThursday evening, along with the blizzard conditions, temperatures will drop to minus 40 and lower in the southern Kivalliq. These frigid temperatures combined with the gusty northwest winds will give extreme wind chill values of minus 60 to minus 65.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least 6 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
