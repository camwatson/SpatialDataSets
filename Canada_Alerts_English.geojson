Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-29T13:35:21-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-07-28T21:36:21-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3881159067.2019<br>Area: Mackenzie Co. near Bistcho Lake, Mackenzie Co. near Rainbow Lake Zama Lake and Chateh, Mackenzie Co. near Zama City, Mackenzie Co. near Indian Cabins and Steen River, Mackenzie Co. near Meander River and Lutose, Mackenzie Co. near High Level and Bushe River Res., Co. of Northern Lights near Paddle Prairie Smt, Mackenzie Co. near the Caribou Mountains, Mackenzie Co. near Fort Vermilion, Mackenzie Co. near John D'or Prairie and Fox Lake, Mackenzie Co. near La Crête and Buffalo Head Prairie, Mackenzie Co. near the Tallcree and Wadlin Lake Reserves",

				"Summary" : "Description: Hot and humid conditions continue into Monday.\n\nDaytime maximum temperatures in the low thirties are expected along with overnight low temperatures near the 20 degree mark.\n\nThere may be a brief respite from the heat in some areas Monday as showers or thunderstorms are possible. \n\nHot and humid air can also bring deteriorating air quality and can result in the Air Quality Health Index to approach the high risk category.\n\nA cold front is expected to deliver a cooler and less humid air mass to the area on Tuesday.\n\n###\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
