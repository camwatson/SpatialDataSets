				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA vigorous Pacific frontal system will move through southern Yukon and northern B.C. tonight bringing heavy snowfall and local blowing snow.\n\nSnow will begin falling this afternoon and increase in intensity tonight. The snow will taper off for most areas on Monday afternoon. The exact track of the system will impact snowfall totals, however total accumulation of 25 to 35 cm is widely expected with some areas across the Cassiar Mountain region, accumulation up to 40 cm is possible.\n\nFor Muncho Lake - Stone Mountain Park, the heaviest snow will be between Muncho Lake and Liard River.\n\nStrong northerly winds will also accompany this system producing blowing snow and poor visibility.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
