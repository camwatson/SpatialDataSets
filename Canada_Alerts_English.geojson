				"Summary" : "Description: Risk of localized severe thunderstorms this evening.\n\nScattered thunderstorms are expected to develop late this afternoon or early this evening in areas near northern Lake Huron. Storm will then move rapidly southeastward this evening reaching portions of the western GTA during the mid to late evening hours. \n\nThere is potential for wind gusts to 100 km/h and large hail. Brief torrential downpours and frequent lightning will also accompany some storms.  As well, there is a risk for an isolated tornado. \n\nThe storms will be localized and some places will not be affected. \n\nThe threat for severe weather will end by midnight.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.\n\nFor more information: http://www.emergencymanagementontario.ca/english/beprepared/beprepared.html.<br>Expires: 2020-06-03T10:54:19-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-02T19:40:19-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3891402931.2020<br>Area: Bruce Peninsula - Sauble Beach - Tobermory, Owen Sound - Blue Mountains - Northern Grey County, Saugeen Shores - Kincardine - Southern Bruce County, Hanover - Dundalk - Southern Grey County, Wingham - Blyth - Northern Huron County, Listowel - Milverton - Northern Perth County, Mount Forest - Arthur - Northern Wellington County, Guelph - Erin - Southern Wellington County, Kitchener - Cambridge - Region of Waterloo, Shelburne - Mansfield - Northern Dufferin County, Orangeville - Grand Valley - Southern Dufferin County, Caledon, Mississauga - Brampton, Halton Hills - Milton, Burlington - Oakville",

Storms will then move rapidly southeastward to reach western portions of the GTA during the mid to late evening hours. \n\nThere is potential for wind gusts to 100 km/h and large hail. Brief torrential downpours and frequent lightning will also accompany some storms. As well, there is a risk for an isolated tornado. \n\nThe storms will be localized and some places will not be affected. \n\nThe threat for severe weather will end by midnight except shortly after midnight for the Niagara area.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Risk of severe thunderstorms this evening.\n\nScattered thunderstorms are expected to develop this evening in areas near northern Lake Huron. Storms will then move rapidly southeastward to reach western portions of the GTA during the mid to late evening hours. \n\nThere is potential for wind gusts to 100 km/h and large hail. Brief torrential downpours and frequent lightning will also accompany some storms. As well, there is a risk for an isolated tornado. \n\nThe storms will be localized and some places will not be affected. \n\nThe threat for severe weather will end by midnight except shortly after midnight for the Niagara area.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.\n\nFor more information: http://www.emergencymanagementontario.ca/english/beprepared/beprepared.html.<br>Expires: 2020-06-03T10:54:29-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-02T22:35:29-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0696035008.2020<br>Area: City of Hamilton, Bruce Peninsula - Sauble Beach - Tobermory, Owen Sound - Blue Mountains - Northern Grey County, Saugeen Shores - Kincardine - Southern Bruce County, Hanover - Dundalk - Southern Grey County, Wingham - Blyth - Northern Huron County, Listowel - Milverton - Northern Perth County, Mount Forest - Arthur - Northern Wellington County, Guelph - Erin - Southern Wellington County, Kitchener - Cambridge - Region of Waterloo, Shelburne - Mansfield - Northern Dufferin County, Orangeville - Grand Valley - Southern Dufferin County, Caledon, Mississauga - Brampton, Halton Hills - Milton, Burlington - Oakville, St. Catharines - Grimsby - Northern Niagara Region, Niagara Falls - Welland - Southern Niagara Region",

These storms will have the potential to produce wind gusts to 100 km/h and large hail.  Frequent lightning and brief torrential downpours may also be associated. \n\nAny thunderstorms are expected to affect fairly narrow areas, with many places likely to not receive storms. However, where they do occur, they could be very intense with even the risk of an isolated tornado.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
