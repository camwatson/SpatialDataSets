In excess of 20 cm over the Great Northern Peninsula and between 5 and 15 cm elsewhere.\n\nPeak wind gusts: easterly to southeasterly 80 to 110 km/h over most coastal areas and 130 to 160 km/h in the Wreckhouse area and along parts of the west coast.  \n\nRemarks: Snow is expected to begin later Tuesday evening over southwestern Newfoundland, then spread up the west coast Tuesday night and to the remainder of the island Wednesday morning.   \n\nStrong east to southeasterly winds will also develop Tuesday night, with the highest gusts occurring late overnight Tuesday into Wednesday.  As a result, most areas will see at least a couple of hours of poor visibilities in snow and blowing snow prior to the snow transitioning through ice pellets and/or freezing rain to rain during the day on Wednesday.  The transition will be much slower over northern Newfoundland where significant snowfall accumulations are expected on Wednesday and warnings likely.  \n\nThe worst of the precipitation and wind will move out of the area by Thursday morning.\n\nAdditionally, high waves, pounding surf and higher than normal water levels are expected along the south coast of Newfoundland on Wednesday from Port aux Basques to the Connaigre Peninsula.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
