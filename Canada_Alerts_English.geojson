It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.

The heaviest snowfall will occur somewhere over Newfoundland's interior, with more of a mixture of snow and rain closer to the coast. Along Newfoundland's east coast, precipitation will fall mostly as rain.\n\nThe location and total of the maximum snowfall amounts remains uncertain at this time.  Temperatures are expected to be mild, which may lead to significantly reduced accumulation.  Variations in the track of the system could also shift where the most snow is expected to fall.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
