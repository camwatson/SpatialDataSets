No new fires may be initiated and no additional material may be added to existing fires.  \n\nFor more information on burning restrictions, see the section  entitled ‘Mandatory Emission Reduction Actions’ and for more information on current air quality, see: \nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nExposure to air pollution is particularly a concern for children, the elderly, and those who have underlying medical conditions such as lung or heart disease.\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-11-06T01:08:04-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls are expected. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nSnow squalls will continue today and taper off this evening.\n\nLocalized amounts of 15 to 20 cm are expected in the snow squalls.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to NTstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #NTStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-11-06T03:08:32-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-11-05T11:09:32-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0625789713.2019<br>Area: Ft.
