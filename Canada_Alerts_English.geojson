Both thunderstorms are tracking east to southeast at 20 to 30 km/h. Golf ball sized hail has been reported with both thunderstorms, with a few stones up to baseball sized in Rathwell. Localized flooding is also a concern due to the slow motion of these thunderstorms.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.
