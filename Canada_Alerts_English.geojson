				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions will be favourable for the development of funnel clouds today.\n\n\n###\n\nThese types of funnel clouds are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nLandspout tornadoes do not usually cause significant damage but can still be dangerous. They can be strong enough to topple trees, damage roofs or toss debris short distances.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ABstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ABStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-08T07:06:14-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-08T03:21:14-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1150330744.2020<br>Area: Cypress Co. near Tide Lake, Cypress Co. near Suffield and Hwy 879, S.A. 2 near Iddesleigh and Dinosaur Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: At 10:13 p.m. CST, Environment Canada meteorologists are tracking a line of severe thunderstorms capable of producing very strong wind gusts, up to nickel size hail and heavy rain.\n\nThis line of severe thunderstorms extends from south of Summerberry  to Oxbow and down to the international border and is traveling east at 60 km/h. This line has a history of producing wind gusts in excess of 100 km/h.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2020-07-08T06:50:05-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-08T04:14:05-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3370809991.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Wolseley including Wolseley and Summerberry, R.M. of Elcapo including Broadview and Cowessess Res., R.M. of Chester including Windthorst Glenavon and Peebles, R.M. of Hazelwood south of Kipling, R.M. of Kingsley including Kipling, R.M. of Silverwood south of Whitewood, R.M. of Wawken including Wawota Kennedy and Kenosee Lake, R.M. of Walpole including Kelso, R.M. of Brock including Arcola and Kisbey, R.M. of Browning including Lampman, R.M. of Moose Creek including Alameda, R.M. of Enniskillen including Oxbow and Northgate, R.M. of Moose Mountain including Carlyle and Manor, R.M. of Antler including Redvers Antler and Wauchope, R.M. of Storthoaks including Storthoaks and Fertile, R.M. of Reciprocity including Alida, R.M. of Mount Pleasant including Carnduff, R.M. of Argyle including Gainsborough and Carievale",

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of very dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing destructive wind gusts, damaging hail and heavy rain.\n\nA significant line of severe thunderstorms has developed over southwestern Saskatchewan and is ongoing. The threat for tornadoes has diminished, however there is still the risk for the development of a tornado embedded in the line while the thunderstorms are ongoing. This watch will continue to be extended to the east as the situation evolves.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Widespread and extremely strong wind gusts can destroy buildings with tornado-like damage, flatten large stands of trees and blow vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
