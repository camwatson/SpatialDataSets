Winds should strengthen early this afternoon, with gusts above 90 km/h likely and gusts above 100 km/h possible at times.  Winds will ease this evening as the system moves into Saskatchewan.  Temperatures will also drop sharply as the cold front moves through.\n\n###\n\nLoose objects may be tossed by the wind and cause injury or damage. High winds may toss loose objects or cause tree branches to break.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Numerous reports of winds gusting in excess of 100 km/h were reported as the front crossed Alberta, and very gusty northwest winds are expected tonight in the wake of this feature as it moves through Saskatchewan. The wind is not expected to be quite as strong as the cold front moves through the province, but many areas in southern Saskatchewan will still see gusts of 80 to 100 km/h tonight.\n\nMuch colder temperatures are expected Saturday in the wake of the cold front.\n\n###\n\nDamage to buildings, such as to roof shingles and windows, may occur. Loose objects may be tossed by the wind and cause injury or damage.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
