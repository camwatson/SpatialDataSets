While it is not certain what the impacts of such a long period of icing will be, there is certainly potential for heavy ice build up in some areas after more than 24 hours of freezing rain.\n\nAlong the coast, 20 to 30 mm of rain is expected by Friday evening.  While this is forecast to remain just below rainfall warning criteria, some localized flooding will be possible due to the rain combining with snow melt runoff.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Utility outages may occur.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
