Strong northerly arctic outflow winds will sharply and suddenly switch to the south or southeast Wednesday night. During the transition, wind gusts could top 100 km/h from the east or southeast.

It is possible that some areas may receive more than 15 cm of snow within 12 hours, and thus Snowfall Warnings may be required.\n\nThe Ontario Storm Prediction Centre will continue to monitor the situation and update the forecast as additional information becomes available.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Possibly higher for Cape Breton.\n\nLocations: Nova Scotia.\n\nTime span: Thursday morning  into Friday.\n\nStorm surge: higher than normal water levels over the southeastern Gulf of St. Lawrence and Cape Breton Island.\n\nRemarks: An intensifying low pressure system approaching from New England will move to lie near southwestern Nova Scotia on Thursday and will skirt the Atlantic Coast before heading away on Friday. This will give snowfall to most of the province. Current guidance suggest the highest amounts may be over western mainland Nova Scotia. Winds may reach or exceed warning criteria over eastern mainland regions and Cape Breton Island Thursday night into Friday.\n\nHigh waves and storm surge may affect the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence and Cape Breton Island on Thursday night into Friday. This may cause some coastal flooding and overwash on north to northeast facing shorelines of the eastern mainland and Cape Breton during the high tides Thursday night and Friday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

During air quality advisories, this bylaw also prohibits recreational fires, use of wood-burning appliances (except for sole wood burning heat users), and street sweeping activities (unless approved by an Authorized Person). Industry is required to follow permit requirements that are triggered during air quality advisories and are asked to reduce emissions wherever possible.\n\n###\n\nPeople with cardiovascular disease can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate the disease leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-01-15T10:14:27-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
