These strong winds will continue into the evening hours.  The visibility should improve late Wednesday evening as winds weaken.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nBlowing snow advisories are issued when winds are expected to create blowing snow giving poor visibility to 800 metres or less for at least 3 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Winter storm over southern Saskatchewan ending tonight. Storm total snowfall will be between 10 to 25 cm. \n\nA strong low pressure system will track along the International border  bringing heavy snow to most of southern Saskatchewan today and into the evening.  A total of 15 to 25 cm is expected through this  evening, generally between the Trans-Canada and Yellowhead Highways. Very poor visibilities at times in snow and blowing snow will occur. \n\nThe snow has eased along the Alberta boundary. Likewise, the snow is also easing from the north in the Outlook, Humbolt, and Kamsack regions and will end completely early this evening. The snow will end in the remaining regions later this evening.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
