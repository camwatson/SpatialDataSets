The band of freezing rain is not continuous, so some areas will see little if any precipitation.  Temperatures are also rising above the freezing mark in the southwest corner of the province, so these areas will see rain and not freezing rain.\n\nThe freezing rain should peter out towards morning.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
