The front combined with the modified arctic air in place will give the potential to produce accumulating snow for neighbourhoods and roadways above 200 metres, including the Malahat Summit and Port Alberni Summit on Hwy 4. Wet snow is possible down to sea level on the mainland side where a cool easterly wind may keep surface temperatures just above the freezing mark. Snowfall amounts of up to 5 cm are possible mainly over higher terrain.\n\nThe front will move out of the region overnight.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
