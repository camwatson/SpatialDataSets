				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls off of Lake Superior possible on Monday.\n\nLocally heavy snow squalls are forecast to develop Monday morning as winds shift to a southwesterly direction. These snow squalls are then expected to continue into Monday night.\n\nSnowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm per 12 hours are possible Monday and Monday night.\n\nDangerous winter driving conditions will be possible Monday. Motorists are advised to adjust their travel plans accordingly.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls off of Georgian Bay beginning this afternoon.\n\nLocally heavy snow squalls are forecast to develop once again this afternoon as strong west to northwest winds become established. These snow squalls are then expected to continue into tonight before weakening on Monday.\n\nAt this point in time, very heavy snowfall amounts in the 15 to 40 cm range appear possible, with the heaviest amounts likely in the Midland to Orillia to Port Carling areas. \n\nWinds will whip up the freshly fallen snow resulting in sudden near zero visibility in blowing snow. \n\nDangerous winter driving conditions are possible this afternoon and tonight. Motorists are advised to adjust their travel plans accordingly. \n\nThe lake effect snow will move to the north of the region by Monday morning.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
