				"Summary" : "Description: Tonight will remain warm with lows around 20 degrees.   Saturday, humidex values will be slightly lower than the last few days and will hover around 35.   However, the humidex values will be higher over strongly urbanized areas of Montreal and its immediate vicinity.  As a result, conditions will feel particularly uncomfortable in these areas.  Temperatures will become comfortable again on Saturday night.\n\nDuring times of high heat, your health or your families and neighbours' health can deteriorate rapidly.\n\nThe Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux du Québec, in cooperation with Environment and Climate Change Canada, recommends that you protect yourself from the effects of the heat by taking the following actions:\n\nDrink 6 to 8 glasses of water per day. Follow your physician's instructions regarding the amount of fluid to drink;\nAvoid alcoholic beverages;\nSpend at least 2 hours a day in air conditioned or cool places;\nTake at least one shower or cool bath per day, or cool your skin several times per day with wet towels;\nLimit physical activities;\nWear light clothes.\n\nBe sure to:\nNever leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle or a closed room, even for a few minutes;\nCheck on your loved ones, especially those vulnerable or living alone.\n\nIf you have questions regarding your health condition, call Info-Santé at 8-1-1 or ask a health care provider. In case of an emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\nFor more information, visit the Government of Quebec's Portail santé mieux-être at www.sante.gouv.qc.ca.\n\n###\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Possible high levels of air pollution due to smoke from forest fires will continue tonight and tomorrow. \n\nSmoke plumes are moving over the region from several forest fires located in the Sandy Lake - Pikangikum region. Winds from the northwest have resulted in the smoke plumes affecting areas to the south and southeast of these fires.  Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\nThese smoke plumes will continue to affect the region into Saturday. \n\nIf you, or someone in your care, develop symptoms, reduce or reschedule strenuous outdoors activities where ever possible until the air quality improves.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-06T16:31:46-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-06T00:32:46-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2604094660.2019<br>Area: Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake, Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell, Pickle Lake - Cat Lake, Red Lake - Woodland Caribou Park, Ear Falls - Perrault Falls - Western Lac Seul, Savant Lake - Sturgeon Lake, Sioux Lookout - Eastern Lac Seul, Kenora - Grassy Narrows - Whitedog, Sioux Narrows - Nestor Falls - Morson, Dryden - Vermilion Bay, Ignace - English River, Fort Frances - Emo - Rainy River, Seine River Village - Mine Centre",

Temperatures will remain cooler for coastal communities along the Bay of Fundy due to onshore breezes.\n\n###\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A very warm air mass will remain over Nova Scotia tonight and Saturday but will finally be displaced Saturday evening as a passing cold front will cause temperature and humidity levels to decrease rapidly. Overnight lows tonight are expected to drop only to 19 degrees.  Temperatures will climb back to near 30 degrees by early Saturday afternoon, with humidex values in the mid to upper 30's over most of the mainland. Temperatures will remain cooler for coastal communities due to onshore breezes.\n\n###\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nInformation is provided on the Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness website at https://novascotia.ca/heat-related-illness/.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
