				"Summary" : "Description: Possible significant snowfall on Sunday.\n\nA developing low pressure system over the American Midwest will affect Southwestern Quebec beginning Sunday afternoon. This system will intensify as it approaches the province.\nDepending on its track, which is still uncertain, this low pressure system could give significant snowfall amounts and cause strong winds over Southern and Central Quebec Sunday night, especially over regions along the northern banks of the St-Lawrence River. It will then spread to eastern Quebec on Monday.\n\nIf the expected track remains the unchanged, precipitation is expected to begin as snow, then gradually change to rain with a risk of freezing rain during the changeover on Monday morning over most areas.\n\nFuture weather statements will provide more details as the low pressure system's track as well as precipitation types and amounts become more certain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
