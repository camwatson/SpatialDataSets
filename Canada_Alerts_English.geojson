Intense snowfall is possible along this front as it tracks southeastward tonight. The front may reach Ogoki to Pickle Lake around midnight. \n\nNear zero visibility is expected in snow and blowing snow. Snowfall accumulations up to 5 centimetres are possible by the time the cold front passes.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: High concentration of pollutants are expected and will result in poor air quality, especially in urban areas where pollutant emissions are higher.\n\nHigh concentrations of pollutants are expected to continue until late this evening or into the overnight hours.\n\n###\n\nSmog especially affects asthmatic children and people with respiratory ailments or heart disease. It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada‚Äôs website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Minist√®re de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montr√©al, visit the R√©seau de surveillance de la qualit√© de l‚Äôair de la Ville de Montr√©al‚Äôs website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Qu√©bec, visit the Minist√®re de la Sant√© et des Services sociaux‚Äôs website at www.quebec.ca/en/health. You can also visit the Direction r√©gionale de sant√© publique du CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l‚Äô√éle-de-Montr√©al at www.santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-02-12T16:59:00-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Minist√®re de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, the Minist√®re de la Sant√© et des Services sociaux, the Direction r√©gionale de sant√© publique du CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l‚Äô√éle-de-Montr√©al, the City of Montr√©al, 2020-02-11T21:21:00-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3326123038.2020<br>Area: Louiseville area, Matawin - Mauricie National Park area, Lac-aux-Sables area, Shawinigan area, Sainte-Anne-de-la-P√©rade area, Trois-Rivi√®res area, Portneuf area, Valcartier - Stoneham area, Qu√©bec area, C√¥te-de-Beaupr√© - L'√éle d'Orl√©ans area, Bellechasse area, L√©vis area, Saint-Lambert area, Lotbini√®re area, B√©cancour - Villeroy area, Victoriaville area, Nicolet area, Drummondville area, Lac-Etchemin area, Sainte-Marie-de-Beauce area, Saint-Georges-de-Beauce area, Montmagny - Saint-Jean-Port-Joli area, Saint-Fabien - Saint-Pamphile area",

A swath of heavy snow is expected to redevelop across much of the province overnight, potentially giving snowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm in just a few hours before the snow ends on Wednesday morning. Reduced visibility in rapidly accumulating snow could have impacts on the morning commute in many parts of the province early Wednesday morning.\n\nIn addition, recent forecast guidance indicates that another system will bring more snow to most of the province on Thursday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
