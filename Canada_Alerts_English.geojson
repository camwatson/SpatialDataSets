Heavy downpours and very strong wind gusts are possible with these thunderstorms. \n\nStrong thunderstorms will develop over Okanagan, Shuswap, Boundary, West Kootenay, Arrow Slocan, Kootenay Lake and East Kootenay regions this evening with possible heavy downpours, very strong wind gusts and large hail.\n\n###\n\nFast-moving water across a road can sweep a vehicle away. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.
