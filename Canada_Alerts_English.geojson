Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nA frontal snow squall will cross the regions later this evening and then lake effect snow bands will continue in a few areas into Wednesday morning.\n\nA cold front moving over the regions from Lake Huron will give low visibilities and a quick accumulation of snow later this evening. Then winds will become northwesterly overnight and isolated lake effect snow squalls will develop. Some of the snow squalls may give snowfall accumulations in excess of 15 centimetres by Wednesday morning, especially northeast of London. Isolated snow squalls may continue into Wednesday afternoon.\n\nTravel may become hazardous tonight into Wednesday.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA Pacific frontal system will continue to cross southern B.C. tonight bringing heavy snowfall to Highway 3 between Paulson Summit and Kootenay Pass. \n\nStorm totals from this two-day event have reached 38 cm (as of 4pm MST) and a further 10-20 cm is expected before precipitation eases Wednesday afternoon.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow and drifting snow will make travel very difficult. Poor weather conditions are likely to contribute to long-lasting transportation delays. Expect road closures as avalanches are possible.\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
