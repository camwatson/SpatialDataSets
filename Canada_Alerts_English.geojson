Significant snowfall accumulations of 20 cm or more are anticipated overnight through Sunday at higher elevations of the Alaska Highway between Fort Nelson and Watson Lake and to the south of Fort Nelson. Significant snowfall accumulations are not expected in Fort Nelson because any snow that does fall will be too wet.

Significant snowfall accumulations of 20 cm or more are anticipated overnight through Sunday at higher elevations of the Alaska Highway between Fort Nelson and Watson Lake and to the south of Fort Nelson. Significant snowfall accumulations are not expected in Fort Nelson because any snow that does fall will be too wet.
