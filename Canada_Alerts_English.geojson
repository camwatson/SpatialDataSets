Total snowfall accumulations of up to 25 cm are expected by late this afternoon. The snow will ease to flurries this afternoon but wind gusts to 70 km/h will give continued blowing snow through this evening.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
