				"Summary" : "Description: An intense low pressure system will bring significant amounts of rain beginning Monday evening through Tuesday evening over Southern and Central Quebec.\n\nFurther north, snowfall amounts of 15 to 25 centimetres are possible from Monday morning to Tuesday evening in a corridor stretching from Abitibi towards Chaleur Bay, including Quebec City. Snow accompanied by moderate winds may reduce visibilities locally in blowing snow.\n\nFreezing rain is likely in the vicinity of the snow-to-rain transition area. A more important episode of freezing rain is also likely for areas of the St. Lawrence Valley between Montreal and Quebec City. Travel could be difficult, especially at rush hour Tuesday morning.\n\nThere is still much uncertainty about the track of this system and thus about the type and amount of precipitation expected.\n\nPlease stay tuned for future forecasts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
