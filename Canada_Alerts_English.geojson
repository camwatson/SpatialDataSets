However, indications are that the Atlantic coastal regions of Nova Scotia will likely receive the most accumulation.\n\nThere is a fair degree of confidence that the Wednesday morning commute will be impacted by this snowfall.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
