Freezing rain will transition to rain over the southern Avalon Peninsula by midday Wednesday and in the afternoon elsewhere. Precipitation will likely remain as freezing rain in the Clarenville area.\n\nSouth Coast: Rain will change to freezing rain overnight. Most areas along the coast will transition back to rain Wednesday morning or afternoon, while inland and higher elevation areas will see mainly freezing rain.  \n\nAnother storm is forecast to affect Newfoundland on Thursday and early Friday. This feature is expected to track a little further south than tonight's system. A variety of snow, ice pellets and potentially freezing rain are anticipated for parts of the South Coast, Burin Peninsula, and northern Avalon Peninsula.\n\nWarnings will likely be required for the Thursday/Friday event. Further details will be provided in subsequent forecasts.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and hazardous.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
