				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing damaging wind gusts and large hail.\n\nAs a cold front traverses Saskatchewan today, thunderstorms are expected to develop along the front. Over southwestern Saskatchewan, some of these thunderstorms may become severe.\n\nThe cold front will be tracking rapidly across Saskatchewan, so the weather may change quickly. Stay alert for updated bulletins as the watch area may be extended later today.\n\nAlso of note, this cold front will bring a change in weather conditions as it pulls down cooler air from the arctic. Expect gusty northwesterly winds and cooler temperatures behind the cold front. Cooler temperatures will persist for the next few days.\n\n###\n\nVery strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
