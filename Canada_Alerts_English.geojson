The freshly fallen snow will combine the gusty windy and falling temperatures to produce blizzard-like conditions at times, with poor visibilities in blowing snow.\n\nThe flurries and squalls are expected to gradually weaken during the day on Friday, with clearing skies to follow for Friday night.\n\nAccumulations will vary considerably depending on the locations of the more intense squalls, with additional amounts through Friday ranging from 5 to 15 cm.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, in collaboration with the Interior Health Authority, has issued a Dust Advisory for Golden due to high concentrations of coarse particulates, which are expected to persist until there is a change in current weather conditions. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted.  Staying indoors and in air-conditioned spaces helps to reduce particulate exposure.  Exposure is particularly a concern for infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-04-05T00:54:26-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
