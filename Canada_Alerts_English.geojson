				"Summary" : "Description: Winter storm threatening Saturday night into Sunday.\n\nAfter a  period of snow giving a few cm of snow tonight into Saturday, a strong moisture laden low from Texas and Louisiana will bring a large area of heavier snow to Northeastern Ontario Saturday night into Sunday.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts of 15 to 25 cm are possible in many areas. In addition, strong northeast winds gusting to 60 km/h will whip up freshly fallen snow with frequent very low to nil visibility in blowing snow especially in exposed areas.\n\nTravel will likely be significantly affected. Travel plans should be changed accordingly.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nWinter storm watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
