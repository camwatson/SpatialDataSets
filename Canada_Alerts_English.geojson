				"Summary" : "Description: Potential blizzard at Iqaluit Sunday.\n\nA low pressure system in Hudson Bay will cross southern Baffin Island this weekend. As the system approaches the area on Saturday, light snow and southeasterly winds of 40 to 50 km/h will bring reduced visibilities in blowing snow for the day. \n\nHowever, much stronger winds are anticipated on Sunday once the system passes northeast of Iqaluit. There is potential for northwesterly winds of 60 gusting 80 km/h or more developing midday Sunday which will likely reduce visibilities to blizzard conditions. The strong winds are expected to continue into the evening before gradually diminishing on Monday morning. \n\nThe current forecast track of the system passes very close to Iqaluit, and as such the strength and exact timing of the strongest winds may change as the low approaches the area.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Blizzard and dangerous extreme cold developing tonight into Saturday.\n\nA low pressure system crossing the northern prairies this evening will bring a surge of bitterly cold air to the Kivalliq tonight as the system moves into Hudson Bay. Northwesterly winds of 50 gusting 70 km/h will develop over the south beginning this evening and expand northeastward into Saturday bringing blowing snow and blizzard conditions to the region. In addition, temperatures by Saturday morning will fall near or below the -40 degree Celsius mark, producing dangerous extreme wind chill values in the -60 to -65 range.\n\nFor Arviat, winds will gradually ease through the day on Saturday ending the blizzard there. Further north along the coast, strong winds and blizzard conditions will continue into Saturday night and Sunday before diminishing. Finally, most sites can expect a second night of extreme cold Saturday night into Sunday before temperatures begin to moderate as well.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least 6 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A period of very cold wind chills is expected.\n\nA low pressure system moving across northern Manitoba and into Hudson Bay this evening will bring cold Arctic air behind it's cold front overnight. Areas in extreme northern Manitoba will see wind chill values between -45 and -50 by Saturday morning.\n\nIn Churchill, wind speeds of 40 km/h with gusts up to 70 km/h from the north are expected this evening behind the cold front as well. The combination of falling snow from today and these strong winds will cause reduced visibilities in blowing snow. Near blizzard conditions are expected. \n\nTemperatures should moderate Saturday morning along with reduced wind speeds, however wind chill values of -45 are expected to return Saturday overnight.\n\n###\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nFor more information on cold and your health, visit Manitoba Health at https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/cold.html or call Health Links - Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
