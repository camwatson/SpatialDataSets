				"Summary" : "Description: Another strong Pacific Storm will affect the region tonight and Saturday.\n\nAs another strong system moves on to the south coast tonight, cold outflow winds will help to lower surface temperatures to near the freezing mark through the evening. \n\nA few flurries are expected before snow develops in earnest later this evening. 2 to 5 cm of snow is forecast tonight. \n\nWarmer air should begin to penetrate inland on Saturday morning, leading to a transition to rain later that morning. An additional 2 to 4 cm are possible on Saturday morning,\n\nTiming this transition from snow to rain is always challenging in these situations. There is a chance that this transition could be delayed resulting in higher snowfall amounts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Expect strong winds and visibility frequently near zero in snow and blowing snow.\n\nAn approaching Pacific storm will spread snow to the region tonight. At the same time, the approaching system will also increase the draw of cold air out from the interior resulting in very strong outflow winds through the inlets and valleys. This combination will result in near zero visibility in blowing snow and extreme wind chill values.\n\nBlizzard conditions will continue into Saturday. The strong outflow winds are expected to moderate Saturday afternoon for Terrace, and Saturday evening over Kitimat. However, periods of heavy snow will continue into Sunday.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be extremely hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least 4 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 cm is expected tonight.\n\nStrong winds will also accompany the storm. As a result blowing snow is expected overnight tonight and Saturday morning.\n\nAs warmer air associated with storm penetrates the region, the snow will begin to transition to freezing rain over Howe Sound.\n\nAcross Howe Sound the transition is expected to occur on Saturday morning. As a result an extended period of heavy snow mixed with freezing rain is expected for much of the day on Saturday and Saturday night.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts up to 30 to 40 cm is expected by Sunday morning.\n\nTiming this transition from snow to freezing rain is always challenging in these situations. There is a chance that this transition could be delayed resulting in higher snowfall amounts.\n\nStay tuned to the latest Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest warnings and forecasts.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult.

Snow is expected to be fairly heavy during the day on Saturday with upwards of 20 cm expected by the end of the day.\n\nSnow will likely continue Saturday night with a few more centimetres possible. A slight risk of freezing rain exists as well on Saturday night, as warmer air aloft pushes inland.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 cm is expected tonight.\n\nStrong winds will also accompany the storm. As a result blowing snow is expected overnight tonight and Saturday morning.\n\nAs warmer air associated with storm penetrates the region, the snow will begin to transition to freezing rain over Howe Sound.\n\nAcross Howe Sound the transition is expected to occur on Saturday morning. As a result an extended period of heavy snow mixed with freezing rain is expected for much of the day on Saturday and Saturday night.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts up to 30 to 40 cm is expected by Sunday morning.\n\nTiming this transition from snow to freezing rain is always challenging in these situations. There is a chance that this transition could be delayed resulting in higher snowfall amounts.\n\nStay tuned to the latest Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest warnings and forecasts.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
