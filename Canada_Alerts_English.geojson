An additional 2 to 4 cm are possible on Saturday morning,\n\nTiming this transition from snow to rain is always challenging in these situations.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA strong Pacific storm arrives tonight with a mix of wintery weather including snow, freezing rain, and blowing snow.\n\nThe storm will arrive tonight with snow beginning this evening across East and Central Vancouver Island. Total snowfall of 10 to 20 cm is expected by Saturday morning.\n\nStrong winds will also accompany the storm. As a result blowing snow is expected overnight tonight and early Saturday morning.\n\nAs warmer air associated with storm penetrates the region, the snow will likely transition to freezing rain over central Vancouver Island overnight tonight. \n\nA complete change over to rain is expected by Saturday morning for all regions. \n\nTiming this transition from snow to freezing rain is always challenging in these situations. There is a chance that this transition could be delayed resulting in higher snowfall amounts.\n\nStay tuned to the latest Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest warnings and forecasts.\n\n###\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-01-18T16:34:08-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-01-18T00:38:08-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0541947875.2020<br>Area: East Vancouver Island - Duncan to Nanaimo, East Vancouver Island - Nanoose Bay to Fanny Bay, East Vancouver Island - Courtenay to Campbell River, Inland Vancouver Island",

Snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 cm is expected tonight.\n\nStrong winds will also accompany the storm. As a result blowing snow is expected overnight tonight and Saturday morning.\n\nAs warmer air associated with storm penetrates the region, the snow will begin to transition to freezing rain over Howe Sound.\n\nAcross Howe Sound the transition is expected to occur on Saturday morning. As a result an extended period of heavy snow mixed with freezing rain is expected for much of the day on Saturday and Saturday night.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts up to 30 to 40 cm is expected by Sunday morning.\n\nTiming this transition from snow to freezing rain is always challenging in these situations. There is a chance that this transition could be delayed resulting in higher snowfall amounts.\n\nStay tuned to the latest Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest warnings and forecasts.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
