				"Summary" : "Description: Significant rain Thursday into Friday.\n\nA strong low pressure system is forecast to track northward out of the Dakotas on Thursday. The track of this low is uncertain at this time, however it does have the potential to bring significant rain and wet, heavy snow to portions of Northwestern and Far Northwestern Ontario. \n\nCurrent indications suggest that precipitation will begin near Lake of the Woods overnight tonight as a mix of rain and snow. The wintry mix will spread north and eastward on Thursday, giving areas from Ear Falls to Quetico Provincial Park up to 10 mm of rain by Friday morning. Precipitation on Friday may bring an additional 20 mm of rain and 5 cm of snow. \n\nPeriods of freezing rain will begin near Lake of the Woods Thursday evening along the transition zone between rain and snow and will progress eastward toward Atikokan through Friday. Nothing more than a light glaze of freezing rain is expected at this time.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The track of this low is uncertain at this time, however it does have the potential to spread heavy wet snow over portions of Northwestern and Far Northwestern Ontario, along the Ontario-Manitoba border. \n\nCurrent indications suggest that precipitation will begin near Lake of the Woods overnight tonight as a mix of rain and snow. The wintry mix will spread north and eastward on Thursday, with areas along the Ontario-Manitoba border most likely to receive snow and areas farther east more likely to receive rain. Snowfall amounts of 5 cm are likely along the Ontario-Manitoba border by Friday morning, with an additional 5 to 10 cm possible on Friday. \n\nPeriods of freezing rain will begin near Lake of the Woods Thursday evening along the transition zone between rain and snow and will progress eastward toward Atikokan through Friday. Nothing more than a light glaze of freezing rain is expected at this time. \n\nA separate Special Weather Statement has been issued for the areas expected to receive a larger proportion of the precipitation as rain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
