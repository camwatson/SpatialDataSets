				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing damaging wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nA large line of thunderstorms is crossing into southwestern Manitoba from Saskatchewan late this evening. Some of these thunderstorms may become severe. Thunderstorms are expected to continue pushing eastward across southern Manitoba through the night.\n\n###\n\nVery strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing damaging wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nAs a cold front continues to traverse Saskatchewan this evening, thunderstorms continue to develop along the front. For much of southeastern Saskatchewan, some of the thunderstorms that develop have the potential to become severe.\n\nThe cold front is tracking rapidly across Saskatchewan, so the weather may change quickly. Stay alert for updated bulletins as the watch area may be extended early this evening.\n\nAlso of note, this cold front will bring a change in weather conditions as it pulls down cooler air from the arctic. Expect gusty northwesterly winds and cooler temperatures behind the cold front. Cooler temperatures will persist for the next few days.\n\n###\n\nVery strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to SKstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #SKStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-07-02T07:59:56-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-02T01:55:56-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2183316791.2019<br>Area: R.M. of McKillop including Strasbourg and Rowans Ravine Prov.
