A narrow band of around 5 cm of snowfall accumulation will stretch from roughly Brandon to Winnipeg to the Ontario border, with possible pockets of higher snowfall accumulations embedded in the main band. There is also a significant risk for freezing rain, over western Manitoba, the Red River Valley and points eastwards during the late evening and overnight hours. \n\nFreezing rain warnings may be required as the event nears and conditions are monitored.\n\nThis low pressure system will usher in a cooler, more seasonal weather pattern.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A shift from the mild, above seasonal weather is coming to southern Saskatchewan.\n\nA fast moving low pressure system tracking across the northern United States is spreading mixed precipitation to southern Saskatchewan. Precipitation is beginning to taper off in the west as the system tracks eastward. \n\nThis low pressure system is bringing a mix of rain, snow and freezing rain to regions in southern Saskatchewan.  A narrow band of 2 to 5 cm of snowfall accumulation will stretch from roughly Swift Current to Regina to the Manitoba border by the time the precipitation leaves the province overnight. Freezing rain is still probable over south central and southeastern areas this evening.\n\nThis low pressure system will usher in a cooler, more seasonal weather pattern.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
