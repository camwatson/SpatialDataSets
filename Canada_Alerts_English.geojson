Additional snowfall up to 4 cm is expected before tapering to flurries this afternoon.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts of 10 to 20 cm are expected by this afternoon.\n\nThe highest snowfall amounts are expected to be north and northwest of the town of Wawa. For Wawa and areas near the shoreline of Lake Superior, snow amounts may be less than 10 cm due to a mix of wet snow and rain last night.\n\nBrisk southwesterly winds with gusts to 60 km/h are expected late this morning that may result in localized blowing snow.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.

Snow may be occasionally heavy at times overnight into Friday morning, with a general 5 to 10 cm of snow expected. Slightly higher amounts may be possible near Georgian Bay and Lake Huron. \n\nLake effect snow squalls will take over Friday morning, and continue into Saturday.
