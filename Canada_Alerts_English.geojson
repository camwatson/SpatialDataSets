				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls are expected to develop. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nTotal snowfall: locally 10 to 15 cm in snow squalls.\n\nLocations: along the Burgeo Highway.\n\nTime span: overnight tonight through the day Thursday.\n\nRemarks: Flurries will become more frequent this evening, with areas of snow squall activity developing as cold westerly winds strengthen. Snow squalls are expected to occur inland, mainly affecting the Burgeo Highway, with just a few flurries along the south coast.\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow with just a few kilometres are common.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
