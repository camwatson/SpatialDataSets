				"Summary" : "Description: Possible high levels of air pollution due to smoke from forest fires will continue today. \n\nSmoke plumes are moving over the region in the vicinity of Pikangikum from several forest fires located west and southwest of the community. There are also a few fires to west and southwest of Sandy Lake. Forecast winds are expected from the northwest today which will drift the smoke to the south and southeast. \n\nThese smoke plumes will continue to affect the region. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-06T04:49:57-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-05T12:50:57-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0663284141.2019<br>Area: Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake, Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell, Pickle Lake - Cat Lake, Red Lake - Woodland Caribou Park, Ear Falls - Perrault Falls - Western Lac Seul",

Local conditions may also affect the concentration of smoke in each community.  Please note that there is no immediate wildfire threat to any Yukon communities.\n\nSmoke can impact your health if it lingers in your community. Please observe the following recommendations: \n\n- You may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, eye or throat irritation, or shortness of breath. If you are experiencing symptoms, limit outdoor activity and/or strenuous physical activity; if breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce the activity.\n\n-\tMake sure you identify and support those who are at increased risk from wildfire smoke. These include small children, elders, pregnant women, and those with lung or heart disease.\n\n-\tIf you have a health condition that could worsen with the smoke (asthma, chronic lung disease or COPD, or heart disease) check in with your health care provider to make sure that you have a plan for managing your condition. Make sure your medications and supplies are available and up-to-date. \n\n-\tReduce exposure to smoky air by staying indoors and turning on an air cleaner with a HEPA filter, if you have one. Keep indoor air as clean as possible by avoiding smoking or burning other materials.\n\n-\tIf your symptoms worsen or you are concerned about your health or the health of a friend/family member, contact the health line at 811, contact your health care provider, or go to your Community Health Centre or hospital emergency department.\n\n-\tFor advice about keeping your home air clean and cool visit www.hss.gov.yk.ca/wildfiresmoke.php\n\n-\tTo view an hourly forecast of smoke conditions in Yukon, visit www.firesmoke.ca/forecasts/current\n\n###\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-05T21:37:52-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Government of Yukon, 2019-07-05T05:38:52-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.4054948915.2019<br>Area: Dawson, Mayo, Beaver Creek, Pelly - Carmacks, Kluane Lake, Haines Junction, Whitehorse, Teslin Y.T., Cassiar Mountains Y.T., Watson Lake Y.T., Faro - Ross River, Dempster, Old Crow",

Forecast winds are expected to shift from west to northwest today. \n\nThese smoke plumes will continue to affect the region. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-06T00:59:06-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-05T09:28:06-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2192178082.2019<br>Area: Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake, Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell",

Humidex values will vary between 37 and 40 on Friday. However, humidex values will exceed 40 over heavily urbanized areas in the City of Montreal and its immediate vicinity. As a result, conditions will feel particularly uncomfortable in these areas.\n\nDuring times of high heat, your health or your families and neighbours' health can deteriorate rapidly.\n\nThe Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux du Québec, in cooperation with Environment and Climate Change Canada, recommends that you protect yourself from heat effects by taking the following actions:\n\nDrink 6 to 8 glasses of water par day. Follow your physician's instructions regarding the amount of fluid to drink;\nAvoid alcoholic beverages;\nSpend at least 2 hours a day in air conditioned or cool places;\nTake at least one shower or cool bath per day, or cool your skin several times per day with wet towels;\nLimit physical activities;\nWear light clothes.\n\nBe sure to:\nNever leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle or a closed room, even for a few minutes;\nCheck on your loved ones, especially those vulnerable or living alone.\n\nIf you have questions regarding your health condition, call Info-Santé at 8-1-1 or ask a health care provider. In case of an emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\nFor more information, visit the Government of Quebec's Portail santé mieux-etre at www.sante.gouv.qc.ca.\n\n###\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
