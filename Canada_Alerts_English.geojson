				"Summary" : "Description: A storm south of Nova Scotia will reach the Gulf of St Lawrence late this evening. Snowfall amounts of 15 to 25 centimetres are expected by Thursday morning over these regions. Later on, behind the system, strong to high winds will reduce visibilities in blowing snow.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Rapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to QCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #QCStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-04-04T11:52:09-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-04-03T19:53:09-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0566920901.2019<br>Area: Grande-Vallée area, Sainte-Anne-des-Monts area, Chandler area, New Carlisle - Port-Daniel area, Forillon National Park - Gaspé area, Percé area, Minganie, Anticosti",

				"Summary" : "Description: ROAD DUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR SMITHERS\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Northern Health has continued a Road Dust Advisory for Smithers because of high concentrations of coarse particulate matter that are expected to persist until there is precipitation or dust suppression. Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted. Exposure is particularly a concern for infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nChildren, including teenagers, are at higher risk from outdoor air pollution because they often spend time being active outdoors. Young people are more likely to have asthma and their lungs are still developing.\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-04-04T07:07:55-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
