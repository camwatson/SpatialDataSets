				"Summary" : "Description: At 6:52 p.m. CST, Environment Canada meteorologists are tracking a cluster of severe thunderstorms capable of producing very strong wind gusts, up to nickel size hail and heavy rain.\n\nThis cluster of severe thunderstorms is located from near Sweetgrass to near Loon Lake and is tracking to the northeast at 55 km/h.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2019-07-28T03:29:48-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-28T00:53:48-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2726618990.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Meadow Lake including Waterhen Res., R.M. of Beaver River including Pierceland and Goodsoil, R.M. of Loon Lake including Loon Lake and Makwa, R.M. of Frenchman Butte including St. Walburg, R.M. of Mervin including Turtleford Mervin and Spruce Lake, R.M. of Turtle River including Edam and Vawn, R.M. of Eldon including Maidstone and Waseca, R.M. of Paynton including Paynton, R.M. of Battle River including Sweet Grass Res. and Delmas, R.M. of Parkdale including Glaslyn and Fairholme, R.M. of Medstead including Medstead Belbutte and Birch Lake, R.M. of Meota including Meota and The Battlefords Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: At 6:27 p.m. CST, Environment Canada meteorologists are tracking a cluster of severe thunderstorms capable of producing very strong wind gusts, up to nickel size hail and heavy rain.\n\nThis cluster of severe thunderstorms is located from near Cutknife to near Onion Lake and is tracking to the northeast at 55 km/h.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2019-07-28T02:59:24-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-28T00:28:24-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2270028254.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Beaver River including Pierceland and Goodsoil, R.M. of Loon Lake including Loon Lake and Makwa, R.M. of Frenchman Butte including St. Walburg, R.M. of Mervin including Turtleford Mervin and Spruce Lake, R.M. of Turtle River including Edam and Vawn, R.M. of Britannia including Hillmond, R.M. of Eldon including Maidstone and Waseca, R.M. of Paynton including Paynton, R.M. of Cut Knife including Cut Knife, R.M. of Battle River including Sweet Grass Res. and Delmas, R.M. of Parkdale including Glaslyn and Fairholme, R.M. of Meota including Meota and The Battlefords Prov.

Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2019-07-28T03:29:39-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-28T00:42:39-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3897440105.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Beaver River including Pierceland and Goodsoil, R.M. of Loon Lake including Loon Lake and Makwa, R.M. of Frenchman Butte including St. Walburg, R.M. of Mervin including Turtleford Mervin and Spruce Lake, R.M. of Turtle River including Edam and Vawn, R.M. of Eldon including Maidstone and Waseca, R.M. of Paynton including Paynton, R.M. of Cut Knife including Cut Knife, R.M. of Battle River including Sweet Grass Res. and Delmas, R.M. of Parkdale including Glaslyn and Fairholme, R.M. of Meota including Meota and The Battlefords Prov.
