				"Summary" : "Description: High elevation snow tonight.\n\nAn upper level disturbance moving southward over the BC coast will usher in a colder airmass for the interior. Snow levels, currently around 1500 metres will fall to about 1000 metres on Saturday. Rain or wet snow over highway passes will change to snow this evening or overnight. Pennask Summit is expected to receive up to 10 cm of snow tonight, while snow over the Coquihalla Highway and Highway 3 are mainly near the summit levels with 5 cm accumulations possible. Lesser amounts are forecast over Rogers Pass. The snow will taper off Saturday morning.\n\nAreas along the BC - Alberta border are expected to see snow as well. In the Elk Valley, freezing levels will hover just above the valley bottom early this evening and will drop tonight. A changeover to snow is likely tonight with periods of snow possibly persisting through Sunday. Again, accumulations remain uncertain at this time, but 5 to 10 cm by Saturday night is plausible.\n\nA return to drier conditions and seasonal temperatures are expected early next week.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: High elevation snow tonight.\n\nAn upper level disturbance moving southward over the BC coast will usher in a colder airmass for the interior. Snow levels, currently around 1500 metres will fall to about 1000 metres on Saturday. Rain or wet snow over highway passes will change to snow this evening or overnight. Pennask Summit is expected to receive up to 10 cm of snow tonight, while snow over the Coquihalla Highway and Highway 3 are mainly near the summit levels with 5 cm accumulations possible. Lesser amounts are forecast over Rogers Pass. The snow will taper off Saturday morning.\n\nAreas along the BC - Alberta border are expected to see snow as well. In the Elk Valley, freezing levels will hover just above the valley bottom early this evening and will drop tonight. A changeover to snow is likely tonight with periods of snow possibly persisting through Sunday. Again, accumulations remain uncertain at this time, but 5 to 10 cm by Saturday night is plausible.\n\nA return to drier conditions and seasonal temperatures are expected early next week.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: The first significant snowfall of the season is expected today through Monday for the Foothills and much of Southern Alberta.\n\nSnow is falling along the central and northern foothills and will spread south and eastwards throughout tonight. The highest accumulations are expected to remain along the foothills and Mountain Parks. Areas near and to the east of Calgary will likely see precipitation transition to snow by this evening, with total accumulations of 10 to 15 cm by Monday morning.\n\nUpslope flow will enhance snowfall in the extreme southwest corner of the province and into Montana. Snowfall accumulations there could reach 40 to 50 cm with some localities seeing 70 cm of snow by Monday morning. A winter storm warning will be issued for those areas. \n\nOn Saturday the heavy snow is expected to move eastward along the United States border bringing 20 to 30 cm of snow to the Lethbridge and Cypress Hills areas by Monday morning. A snowfall warning will be issued for those areas. \n\nPoor driving conditions throughout the weekend can be expected in southwestern Alberta, including portions of Highway 1 and the QEII.\n\nHeavy wet snow may cause tree branches to break. \n\nWet snow may also cause power outages. \n\nThis is expected to be a long duration event, with snow beginning this morning and tapering off by Monday. Temperatures are forecast to rebound into the low-mid teens by mid-week, making this brief brush with winter just that...brief.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: The first significant snowfall of the season is expected today through Monday for the Foothills and much of Southern Alberta.\n\nSnow is falling along the central and northern foothills and will spread south and eastwards throughout tonight. The highest accumulations are expected to remain along the foothills and Mountain Parks. Areas near and to the east of Calgary will likely see precipitation transition to snow by this evening, with total accumulations of 10 to 15 cm by Monday morning.\n\nUpslope flow will enhance snowfall in the extreme southwest corner of the province and into Montana. Snowfall accumulations there could reach 40 to 50 cm with some localities seeing 70 cm of snow by Monday morning. A winter storm warning will be issued for those areas. \n\nOn Saturday the heavy snow is expected to move eastward along the United States border bringing 20 to 30 cm of snow to the Lethbridge and Cypress Hills areas by Monday morning. A snowfall warning will be issued for those areas. \n\nPoor driving conditions throughout the weekend can be expected in southwestern Alberta, including portions of Highway 1 and the QEII.\n\nHeavy wet snow may cause tree branches to break. \n\nWet snow may also cause power outages. \n\nThis is expected to be a long duration event, with snow beginning this morning and tapering off by Monday. Temperatures are forecast to rebound into the low-mid teens by mid-week, making this brief brush with winter just that...brief.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: The first significant snowfall of the season is expected to continue to develop tonight and persist through Monday for the Foothills and much of Southern Alberta.\n\nSnow has begun falling along the foothills and will continue to spread south and eastwards throughout the night. The highest accumulations are expected to remain along the foothills and Mountain Parks. Areas near and to the west of Calgary have seen precipitation transition to snow this evening, with total accumulations of 10 to 15 cm expected by Monday morning.\n\nUpslope flow will enhance snowfall in the extreme southwest corner of the province and into Montana. Snowfall accumulations there could reach 40 to 50 cm with some localities seeing 70 cm of snow by Monday morning. A winter storm warning has been issued for those areas. \n\nOn Saturday the heavy snow is expected to move eastward along the United States border bringing 20 to 30 cm of snow to the Lethbridge and Cypress Hills areas by Monday morning. A snowfall warning has been issued for those areas. \n\nPoor driving conditions throughout the weekend can be expected in southwestern Alberta, including portions of Highway 1 and the QEII.\n\nHeavy wet snow may cause tree branches to break. \n\nWet snow may also cause power outages. \n\nThis is expected to be a long duration event, with snow tapering off by Monday. Temperatures are forecast to rebound into the low-mid teens by mid-week, making this brief brush with winter just that...brief.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: The first significant snowfall of the season is expected to continue to develop tonight and persist through Monday for the Foothills and much of Southern Alberta.\n\nSnow has begun falling along the foothills and will continue to spread south and eastwards throughout the night. The highest accumulations are expected to remain along the foothills and Mountain Parks. Areas near and to the west of Calgary have seen precipitation transition to snow this evening, with total accumulations of 10 to 15 cm expected by Monday morning.\n\nUpslope flow will enhance snowfall in the extreme southwest corner of the province and into Montana. Snowfall accumulations there could reach 40 to 50 cm with some localities seeing 70 cm of snow by Monday morning. A winter storm warning has been issued for those areas. \n\nOn Saturday the heavy snow is expected to move eastward along the United States border bringing 20 to 30 cm of snow to the Lethbridge and Cypress Hills areas by Monday morning. A snowfall warning has been issued for those areas. \n\nPoor driving conditions throughout the weekend can be expected in southwestern Alberta, including portions of Highway 1 and the QEII.\n\nHeavy wet snow may cause tree branches to break. \n\nWet snow may also cause power outages. \n\nThis is expected to be a long duration event, with snow tapering off by Monday. Temperatures are forecast to rebound into the low-mid teens by mid-week, making this brief brush with winter just that...brief.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Early significant snowfall to affect southwestern Saskatchewan...\n\nA major early-season winter storm is expected to spread snow from Alberta and Montana into southwestern Saskatchewan beginning Saturday afternoon and continuing Saturday night, all day Sunday, and into Monday. Snowfall accumulations on Saturday should be minimal due to the snow melting on contact with the warmer ground, but Saturday night through Sunday and Monday will likely see significant snowfall accumulation, especially over the higher terrain of the Cypress Hills.  Potential accumulations by Monday morning range from over 30 cm for the Cypress Hills with widespread accumulations of 10-20 cm elsewhere.  The snow will be accompanied by strong northeast winds giving blowing snow on Sunday.  Travel will become increasingly difficult Saturday night through Sunday. \n\nThis is a dynamic and evolving weather event.  Watch for updated forecasts and potential warnings as this storm draws nearer.

				"Summary" : "Description: Frost may destroy crops.\n\nCloudy skies linger over much of southern Saskatchewan late this evening with temperatures only a degree or two above zero. As a high pressure ridge continues to build into the area, skies will partially clear, especially over the northern grainbelt towards morning.
