If you are experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, follow the advice of your health care provider. Staying indoors and in air conditioned spaces helps to reduce fine particulate exposure. Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-12-08T04:55:05-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

A strong northerly wind will accompany the snow tonight resulting in reduced visibilities, at times near zero, in blowing snow.  Conditions will improve Sunday morning as the snow tapers and winds diminish.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
