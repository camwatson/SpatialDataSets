Temperatures are expected to drop to below the freezing mark on Saturday, changing the rain into freezing rain. Several hours of freezing rain may occur until temperatures climb to above freezing again on Sunday. This scenario is expected to result in significant ice accretion over these regions. \n\nStrong southwest winds gusting to 70 km/h are also expected Sunday morning, with the highest gusts occurring along the shores of Lake Huron. Strong winds coupled with ice build-up on tree branches and power lines could cause power outages in the hardest hit areas.\n\nRainfall amounts may reach up to 25 mm, although there remains considerable uncertainty at this time. Warnings will be issued as the event draws nearer.\n\nTravel will be impacted throughout Southern Ontario Saturday into Sunday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

On Sunday, precipitation will intensify and change to snow or ice pellets over the whole area.  Brief periods of freezing rain are also possible.\n\nPeople should expect mainly poor travelling conditions as of Saturday evening.\n\nIn addition, strong gusts of 60-70 km/h are expected on Sunday,  which could cause local blowing snow.\n\nThere is still some uncertainty regarding the track of this system, which could impact the total amounts of snow and ice pellets.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Rain will likely spread throughout the province Saturday, but it will likely turn into a mixture of freezing rain and ice pellets on Sunday. Rain could persist longer over the Southwestern Shore. Also, the precipitation changeover to snow could occur quicker over Cape Breton leading to potentially more snowfall accumulation.

Freezing precipitation amounts could be significant and make surfaces such as roads, streets and sidewalks slippery and hazardous. Strong gusts of 60-70 km/h are also expected on Sunday, and may possibly impact ice-covered structures such as tree limbs and power lines.\n\nThe Outaouais, the Laurentians and Lanaudière regions could also see some snow and ice pellets beginning Saturday afternoon.\n\nThere is still some uncertainty regarding the track of this system, which may affect total rainfall and freezing precipitation amounts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
