Additional amounts of 5 to 15 cm are possible Wednesday night into Thursday morning.\n\nLocal blowing snow reducing visibilities will also be a concern. \n\nLocal snow squalls are forecast to taper off when the winds shift to the northwest on Thursday.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
