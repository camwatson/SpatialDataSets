				"Summary" : "Description: Heavy rain for the Central Interior, Cariboo, Thompson and Columbia regions though Thursday evening. \n\nMoist easterly flow associated with a deep Alberta low will stream moisture across the Rocky Mountains and into B.C. today and Thursday. \n\nComputer guidance continues to suggest that 25 to 40 mm total rainfall will fall through Thursday night. Higher rainfall amounts are expected over the mountains, especially over the Williston, McGregor, and Cariboo regions where storm totals will reach 50 to 70 mm. In addition to the widespread synoptic rain, thunderstorms will have the potential of adding 15-25 mm locally over short periods.\n\nAlthough the rainfall amounts may not be exceptionally heavy, the significance of this event is due to the potential for rising rivers levels. There is significant concern for high flows in the Quesnel River (Cariboo Mountains), the North Thompson (Blue River/Clearwater region), and South Thompson (Shuswap). \n\nOn Thursday the precipitation will become more showery in nature, but  thunderstorms will cause significant local contribution to rainfall totals well into Thursday evening.  \n\nRainfall warnings may be issued as the system further develops and confidence in rainfall amounts increases.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-02T12:48:06-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-01T20:49:06-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.4167640895.2020<br>Area: South Thompson, Shuswap, North Thompson, North Columbia, Cariboo - north including Quesnel, Cariboo - south including Williams Lake, 100 Mile, Yellowhead, Williston, Prince George, McGregor",

This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground.

				"Summary" : "Description: A long episode of rain, at times heavy, is expected.\n\n40 to 70 mm total rainfall is expected to fall over over the Peace River and Fort Nelson regions through Thursday night. The higher end of the range will occur near the eastern slopes of the Rockies. Locally in the Rockies, rainfall amounts may exceed 90 mm during the event. \n\nOver Muncho Lake Park-Stone Mountain park, 40 to 80 mm of rainfall is forecast for the event with the higher end of the range occurring over eastern sections over communities like Tetsa River.\n\nThe heavy rain is being caused by low pressure centre drifting northwards through Alberta today. Strong and moist easterly flow associated with the low will cause enhanced precipitation as the flow encounters the eastern slopes of the Rockies. \n\nOn Thursday the low will weaken somewhat and stall near the AB-BC border. The character of the precipitation will become more showery. But widespread thunderstorms will develop Thursday afternoon and continue Thursday evening. These storms will cause local downpours that will contribute to storm rainfall totals well into Thursday night.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Heavy rain for the Central Interior, Cariboo-Chilcotin, Thompson and Columbia regions though Thursday evening. \n\nMoist easterly flow associated with a deep Alberta low will stream moisture across the Rocky Mountains and into B.C. tonight and Thursday. \n\nComputer guidance continues to suggest that 25 to 40 mm total rainfall will fall through Thursday night. Higher rainfall amounts are expected over the mountains, especially over the Williston, McGregor, and Cariboo regions where storm totals will reach 50 to 70 mm. In addition to the widespread synoptic rain, thunderstorms will have the potential of adding 15-25 mm locally over short periods.\n\nAlthough the rainfall amounts may not be exceptionally heavy, the significance of this event is due to the potential for rising rivers levels. There is significant concern for high flows in the Quesnel River (Cariboo Mountains), the North Thompson (Blue River/Clearwater region), and South Thompson (Shuswap). \n\nOn Thursday the precipitation will become more showery in nature, but  thunderstorms will cause significant local contribution to rainfall totals well into Thursday evening.  \n\nRainfall warnings may be issued as the system further develops and confidence in rainfall amounts increases.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
