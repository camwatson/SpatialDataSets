The worst period of blowing snow is expected this afternoon until midnight. \n\nDiscussion: \nSnow squalls will continue through tonight off Lake Huron and Georgian Bay. Widespread blowing snow with possible blizzard-like conditions is the biggest concern this afternoon and evening. Some areas may see heavy snowfall accumulation as well.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Road closures are possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The heaviest snowfall accumulation is expected in an area that includes Kincardine, Ripley, Lucknow, Wingham, and Gorrie. \n\nWhen: \nNow through tonight. The worst period of blowing snow is expected this afternoon until midnight. The period of heaviest snowfall is expected this evening. \n\nDiscussion: \nSnow squalls will continue through tonight off Lake Huron. Widespread blowing snow with possible blizzard-like conditions is the biggest concern this afternoon and evening. Some areas may see heavy snowfall accumulation as well.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Road closures are possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
