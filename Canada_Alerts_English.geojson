				"Summary" : "Description: Wet snow likely near the Rocky Mountains tonight and Friday.\n\nA cooler airmass is settling in over northeastern BC this morning and is expected to remain in place through the weekend. A slow moving disturbance will continue to give periods of rain mixed at times with wet snow into Friday.\n\nPortions of Highway 97 near the Rocky Mountains will likely see snowfall accumulations tonight. Areas along the highway west of Fort Nelson leading into Tetsa River National Park and south near Buckinghorse River and Sikanni Chief could see 5 to 10 cm of wet snow tonight.\n\nFurther south in the Peace River region, pockets of wet snow have been reported this morning. The potential for rain mixed at times with wet snow will linger into Friday afternoon. A few centimetres of wet snow is possible today through Friday over the Peace River District, as well as Highway 97 and the Pine Pass west of Chetwynd.\n\nCooler but drier conditions will prevail through the weekend with a return to near seasonal values early next week.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Wet snow likely near the Rocky Mountains tonight and Friday.\n\nA cooler airmass is settling in over northeastern BC this morning and is expected to remain in place through the weekend. A slow moving disturbance will continue to give periods of rain mixed at times with wet snow into Friday.\n\nPortions of Highway 97 near the Rocky Mountains will likely see snowfall accumulations tonight. Areas along the highway west of Fort Nelson leading into Tetsa River National Park and south near Buckinghorse River and Sikanni Chief could see 5 to 10 cm of wet snow tonight.\n\nFurther south in the Peace River region, pockets of wet snow have been reported this morning. The potential for rain mixed at times with wet snow will linger into Friday afternoon. A few centimetres of wet snow is possible today through Friday over the Peace River District, as well as Highway 97 and the Pine Pass west of Chetwynd.\n\nCooler but drier conditions will prevail through the weekend with a return to near seasonal values early next week.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A long duration snowfall event starting the afternoon of Friday September 27 through Monday September 30 is anticipated for parts of southwestern Alberta as a moisture laden Pacific weather system tracks through the area.\n\nThere is still uncertainty around snowfall accumulations as warm surface temperatures will melt initial snowfall. Current indications suggest that by Monday, total accumulations of 15 to 30 cm over portions of southwestern Alberta are possible. \n\nFor the extreme southwest corner of the province, upslope flow will enhance snowfall along higher terrain with localized snowfall totals of over 50 cm possible by Monday.\n\n\nHeavy snowfall accumulation may cause tree branches to break.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
