Intense lightning, large hail and locally heavy downpours are occurring with this line of thunderstorms.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.<br>Expires: 2020-07-13T05:18:26-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-13T02:21:26-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2935912317.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Griffin including Griffin and Froude, R.M. of Cymri including Midale Macoun and Halbrite, R.M. of Benson including Benson, R.M. of Wolseley including Wolseley and Summerberry, R.M. of Elcapo including Broadview and Cowessess Res., R.M. of Chester including Windthorst Glenavon and Peebles, R.M. of Hazelwood south of Kipling, R.M. of Golden West including Ocean Man Res. and Handsworth, R.M. of Kingsley including Kipling, R.M. of Tecumseh including Stoughton Forget and Heward, R.M. of Brock including Arcola and Kisbey",

Thunderstorms will track to the east and northeast through the evening. Some thunderstorms may produce large hail, damaging winds and locally heavy downpours, along with frequent lightning.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, damaging hail and heavy rain.\n\nAn area of severe thunderstorms in southeastern Saskatchewan is moving slowly eastward and will likely move into western Manitoba around midnight and persist overnight.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
