Vulnerable vessels are most at risk and should seek safe harbour if underway.\n\nConsider delaying or postponing travel in areas under the squall watch.\n\nLarge hail can damage vessels and cause injury.\n\nVessels without lightning protection should make their way to shore immediately.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage vessels and cause injury.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nA low pressure trough pushing into western Manitoba today combined with a warm and humid airmass will trigger thunderstorms this afternoon and evening, some of which have the potential to become severe. \n\nThe thunderstorms will push into the Red River Valley by late afternoon and southeastern regions this evening, so watches may have to be extended eastward later today.\n\n###\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
