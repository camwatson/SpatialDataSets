The main band of snow will shift northwards on Friday morning,  allowing the snow to come to an end for communities in the Okanagan, South Thompson, and Kootenays. However over the Columbias, the central and northern interior the snow will continue all day.\n\nThe highest snowfall amounts are expected to be over the Bulkley Valley, McGregor, Yellowhead and Williston regions.\n\nIn addition there is a chance of freezing rain for the central interior as the band of snow pushes northwards on Friday morning.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Precipitation has begun over Vancouver Island and will spread to the south coast early this afternoon. Strong southeasterly winds will also develop this afternoon.\n\nInitially temperatures will be cold enough to allow some of the precipitation to start as wet snow  over Vancouver Island and higher elevations of the south coast. \n\nBy this evening warm air accompanying the storm will drive freezing levels and temperatures higher so that precipitation changes to rain for most communities. The exception may be Whistler and the Sea to Sky Highway from Squamish to Whistler where snow could persist longer.\n\nThe heavy rain and strong winds continue all day on Friday. The highest rainfall amounts will be over the central coast, north and west Vancouver Island. Areas of Squamish, northern sections of Metro Vancouver, and the Fraser Valley will also see significant amounts of rainfall.\n\nIn areas where snow does accumulate, a higher chance of localized flooding is possible due to rain on snow.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Visibilities will be rapidly reduced due to heavy flurries, gusty winds and blowing snow.\n\nA major highway particularly affected this morning is Highway 1, east of Calgary. These snow squalls are moving quickly from west to east-southeast.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nSnow squall warnings are issued when bands of snow form that produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
