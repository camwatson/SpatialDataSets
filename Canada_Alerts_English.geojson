				"Summary" : "Description: A spring storm, forecast to develop over southern Alberta on Saturday, will bring an assortment of weather to the southwestern half of the grainbelt over the weekend. \n\nShowers and possible thunderstorms associated with the disturbance will enter southwestern Saskatchewan Saturday morning then gradually change over to wet snow late Saturday afternoon into Saturday evening. Accumulating snowfall is expected Saturday night with the heaviest amounts of 10 to 15 cm falling over the Kindersley, Outlook and Leader areas. The snow will then shift to the southeast with similar amounts of 10 to 15 cm expected to fall over areas south of the Trans-Canada Highway on Sunday. Total snowfall accumulations in some areas may exceed 30 cm by late Sunday especially over higher terrain.\n\nIn addition to the snow, strong northeasterly winds will combine with the heavy wet snow to produce poor visibilities and possible blizzard conditions. The snow and strong winds are expected to exit the region Sunday night. \n\nThe public is advised to monitor Environment Canada for upcoming weather warnings.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A spring storm is forecast to move into Alberta bringing a wide range of weather conditions to the southern third of Alberta on Saturday.\n\nBeginning Saturday afternoon, showers are expected to develop over southeastern Alberta with possible embedded thunderstorms. With these weak non severe thunderstorms, there is a possibility of seeing a funnel cloud or two develop as the low passes over the Brooks to Medicine Hat region in the afternoon hours. \n\nThe rain showers over southeastern Alberta will quickly change over to snow in the early evening hours with total amounts in the 15 to 25 cm range for areas from Coronation to the Cypress Hills with enhanced amounts over the Cypress Hill possibly exceeding 30 cm. Additionally, strong easterly to northeasterly winds will develop overnight Saturday night giving blizzard like conditions to the area.\n\nOver western Alberta, a quick blast of snow to the Highway 2 corridor will combine with northerly winds gusting to 90 km/h, giving possible brief whiteout conditions to the area in the later afternoon hours.\n\nOver the Kananaskis region, possible snowfall accumulations may reach 20 cm starting Saturday afternoon and tapering off Sunday morning.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nWinter storm watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
