				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, damaging hail and heavy rain.\n\nThunderstorms, with the potential for severe weather, will continue to move eastwards through east-central Alberta this evening. \n\nPotentially severe thunderstorms may redevelop later tonight over central regions, behind this initial line of thunderstorms. Confidence is lower in this scenario, however, high enough to continue this watch.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ABstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ABStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-17T09:59:43-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-17T02:36:43-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3439072082.2020<br>Area: Brazeau Co. near Cynthia and Lodgepole, Yellowhead Co. near Minnow and Wolf Lakes and Elk River, O'Chiese 203 Res. and Clearwater Co. near Sunchild Cree Res., Brazeau Co. near Brazeau Dam, Clearwater Co. near Rocky Mtn House and Crimson Lake, Clearwater Co. near Caroline and James River Bridge, Lacombe Co. near Eckville, Lacombe Co. near Lacombe Blackfalds and Bentley, Lacombe Co. near Clive Alix and Mirror, Red Deer Co. near Sylvan Lake and Stephansson House, Red Deer Co. near Spruce View and Red Lodge Prov.

Temperatures overnight will remain in the low to mid twenties, providing little relief from the heat. \n\nHot and humid air can also bring deteriorating air quality and can result in the Air Quality Health Index approaching the high risk category.\n\nSlightly cooler and less humid conditions may arrive on Tuesday.\n\n###\n\nWatch for the effects of heat illness: swelling, rash, cramps, fainting, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and the worsening of some health conditions.\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, damaging hail and heavy rain.\n\nThunderstorms, with the potential for severe weather, will continue to move eastwards through east-central Alberta this evening. \n\nPotentially severe thunderstorms may redevelop later tonight over central-south regions, behind this initial line of thunderstorms. Confidence is lower in this scenario, however, high enough to continue this watch.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ABstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ABStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-17T10:59:24-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-17T03:15:24-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1465740153.2020<br>Area: City of Lloydminster, Lac La Biche Co. near Plamondon Hylo and Avenir, Lac La Biche Co. near Heart Lake, Lac La Biche Co. near Lac La Biche and Square Lake, Lac La Biche Co. near Lakeland Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, damaging hail and heavy rain.\n\nThunderstorms, with the potential for severe weather, will continue to move eastwards through east-central Alberta this evening. \n\nPotentially severe thunderstorms may redevelop later tonight over central regions, behind this initial line of thunderstorms. Confidence is lower in this scenario, however, high enough to continue this watch.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ABstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ABStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-17T09:59:43-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-17T02:36:43-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0964250595.2020<br>Area: City of Lloydminster, Lac La Biche Co. near Plamondon Hylo and Avenir, Lac La Biche Co. near Heart Lake, Lac La Biche Co. near Lac La Biche and Square Lake, Lac La Biche Co. near Lakeland Prov.
