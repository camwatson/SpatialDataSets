Conditions will deteriorate to blizzard as winds gusting up to 80 km/h develop by midnight accompanied by falling snow. Near zero visibilities are likely throughout the remainder of the night and all of Tuesday. \n\nThe blizzard will ease early Wednesday morning when the low moves off into Baffin Bay.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be extremely hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least 6 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Rainfall amounts of up to 40 mm are also expected. The heavy precipitation will end by early this evening as the low moves to the east.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.
