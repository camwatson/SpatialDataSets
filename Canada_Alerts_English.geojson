				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls are expected to develop. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nSnow squalls from Southern Lake Huron may move into Western Lambton County later this afternoon and persist through tonight.\n\nSnowfall amounts in the strongest snow squalls may reach 15 cm tonight.\n\nDangerous winter driving conditions are possible tonight in many areas including Highway 402. \n\nSnow squalls will weaken to a few flurries Monday morning.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero. Road closures are possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-01-20T09:18:40-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-01-19T17:19:40-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2358990565.2020<br>Area: Sarnia - Petrolia - Western Lambton County",

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls today.\n\nA strong snow squall off of Southern Lake Huron extends from near Grand Bend across London to the Thamesford and Ingersoll areas. \n\nSnowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm in a few hours are possible with this snow squall. In addition, sudden near zero visibility from blowing snow and bursts of heavy snow are expected as the snow squall moves in.\n\nThe snow squall will move south of the area this afternoon. However new snow squalls are expected to develop off of Southern Lake Huron later this afternoon when the winds shift to a more northerly direction. These will affect Eastern Lambton County and Middlesex County mainly west of the City of London.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-01-20T09:07:07-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-01-19T17:08:07-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0868278754.2020<br>Area: Watford - Pinery Park - Eastern Lambton County, London - Parkhill - Eastern Middlesex County, Strathroy - Komoka - Western Middlesex County",
