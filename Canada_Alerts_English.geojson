				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions will be favourable for the development of funnel clouds today.\n\nEnvironment Canada meteorologists received reports of funnel clouds near Olds around 3:20 P.M.. The thunderstorms responsible for the funnel clouds are moving towards the southeast at 45 km/h.\n\n###\n\nThese types of funnel clouds are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nIf conditions become more favourable for the development of landspout tornadoes, watches and warnings will be issued by Environment Canada.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
