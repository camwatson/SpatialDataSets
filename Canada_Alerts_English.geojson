Strong winds combined with snow will generate blowing snow and lower the visibility to 800 metres or less tonight near the Richardson Mountains. Conditions will improve overnight as the wind weakens.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nBlowing snow advisories are issued when winds are expected to create blowing snow giving poor visibility to 800 metres or less for at least 3 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
