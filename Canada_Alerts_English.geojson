				"Summary" : "Description: Early August Heavy Rainfall for Vancouver Island and the South Coast of British Columbia.\n\nAn unseasonably strong Pacific front is poised to drench Vancouver Island and parts of the south coast beginning on Thursday. The front will tap into subtropical moisture which will amplify the front and help to enhance the rainfall totals.\n\nThe main area of rain will begin over west and inland Vancouver Island overnight. The rain will spread to areas of east Vancouver Island from Nanaimo to the Comox Valley, and over the Sunshine Coast on Thursday morning. The rain will intensify and become heavy on Thursday afternoon. \n\nOver Howe Sound, Whistler, and northern sections of Metro Vancouver there may be some scattered showers on Thursday ahead of the main plume of moisture associated with the front. The main area of rain will develop later on Thursday afternoon and Thursday evening as the front moves eastward. \n\nThe heavy rain will end Thursday night as the front pushes eastward. In the front’s wake there will be showers with a risk of thunderstorms and gusty winds on Friday morning. \n\nThere remains some uncertainty with respect to the location of where the heaviest precipitation amounts will occur. Stay tuned to Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest forecasts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke may be causing poor air quality and reducing visibility.\n\nPoor air quality due to forest fire smoke is expected to improve overnight.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk. If you, or someone in your care, develop symptoms, reduce strenuous outdoors activities where ever possible until the air quality improves.\n\nWhen outdoors, if your breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce strenuous physical activities. If you experience irritation of eyes, nose or throat, shortness of breath or other respiratory symptoms, you should take action to reduce your exposure to smoke. \n\nIf you are feeling unwell and experiencing symptoms, contact your health care provider for advice.\n\nIssued jointly by Environment Canada and the Northwest Territories Departments of Environment and Natural Resources and Health and Social Services.\n\nFor more information on air quality and your health, please visit the Northwest Territories Department of Health and Social Services at www.hss.gov.nt.ca/en/services/environmental-health/air-quality.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-08-01T13:18:29-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Northwest Territories Departments of Environment and Natural Resources and Health and Social Services, 2019-07-31T21:19:29-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3093233654.2019<br>Area: Wrigley Region",

Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.
