The higher snowfall amounts are expected over the escarpment.\n\nWhen: From 8:00 A.M. EST today to 9:00 P.M. EST tonight.\n\nImpacts: Rapidly accumulating snow may make travel difficult. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow and local blowing snow. There may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas.\n\nDiscussion: Snow heavy at times will affect areas along the Niagara Escarpment. Easterly flow over the relatively warm waters of Lake Ontario along with the higher terrain of the Niagara Escarpment will both help to locally boost snowfall amounts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total amounts of about 15 cm is expected.\n\nWhat: Total snowfall amounts near 15 cm.\n\nWhere: Mississauga, Brampton and Halton region. \n\nWhen: From 8:00 A.M. EST today to 9:00 P.M. EST tonight.\n\nImpacts: Rapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow and local blowing snow. There may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas.\n\nDiscussion: Snow heavy at times will affect areas near the west end of Lake Ontario today. Easterly flow over the relatively warm waters of Lake Ontario along with the higher terrain of the Niagara Escarpment will both help to locally boost snowfall amounts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
