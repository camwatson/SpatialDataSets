Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-06-08T21:59:42-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-06-08T10:19:42-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0618541585.2019<br>Area: Thorhild Co. near Thorhild Opal and Radway, Sturgeon Co. near Bon Accord Gibbons and Namao, Sturgeon Co. near Redwater, Lamont Co. near Bruderheim Lamont and Peno Creek, Lamont Co. near Andrew and Wostok, Lamont Co. near Mundare Chipman and Ukrainian Village, Smoky Lake Co. near Smoky Lake and Waskatenau, Co. of Two Hills near Willingdon and Hairy Hill, Fort Saskatchewan and Nrn Strathcona Co., Elk Island Nat.
