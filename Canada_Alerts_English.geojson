Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nLater this afternoon, cold arctic air moving over Great Slave Lake will create favourable conditions for snow squalls to develop. Snow squalls are likely to persist until Saturday morning. Local snowfall accumulations of 10 to 20 cm are possible.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
