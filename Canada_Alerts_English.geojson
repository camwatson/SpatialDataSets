				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility over much of the province. \n\nThe thickest smoke currently extends from northeastern British Columbia through eastern portions of Grande Prairie, Whitecourt, Drayton Valley, Red Deer and much of southern Alberta. The foothills should continue to see improvement this morning and into the early afternoon with the rest of southern Alberta improving Saturday. Currently eastern portions of Alberta have improved air quality and visibility in smoke however, conditions over these regions are expected to worsen late this afternoon and into the evening hours.\n\nNorthern Alberta will remain in areas of smoke this weekend.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-06-02T02:55:24-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-06-01T10:56:24-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0307865791.2019<br>Area: City of Lloydminster, Lacombe Co. near Eckville, Lacombe Co. near Lacombe Blackfalds and Bentley, Lacombe Co. near Clive Alix and Mirror, Red Deer Co. near Sylvan Lake and Stephansson House, Red Deer Co. near Spruce View and Red Lodge Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility over much of the province. \n\nThe thickest smoke currently extends from northeastern British Columbia through eastern portions of Grande Prairie, Whitecourt, Drayton Valley, Red Deer and much of southern Alberta. The foothills should continue to see improvement overnight tonight with the rest of southern Alberta improving Saturday.\n\nNorthern Alberta will remain in areas of smoke this weekend.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-06-01T20:21:45-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-06-01T04:22:45-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1398165953.2019<br>Area: City of Lloydminster, Brazeau Co. near Cynthia and Lodgepole, Yellowhead Co. near Minnow and Wolf Lakes and Elk River, O'Chiese 203 Res. and Clearwater Co. near Sunchild Cree Res., Brazeau Co. near Brazeau Dam, Clearwater Co. near Rocky Mtn House and Crimson Lake, Clearwater Co. near Caroline and James River Bridge, Lacombe Co. near Eckville, Lacombe Co. near Lacombe Blackfalds and Bentley, Lacombe Co. near Clive Alix and Mirror, Red Deer Co. near Sylvan Lake and Stephansson House, Red Deer Co. near Spruce View and Red Lodge Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoky Skies Bulletin - May 31, 2019\n\nSeveral regions of BC are being impacted or are likely to be impacted by wildfire smoke over the next 24-48 hours. The next bulletin update will be available June 01, 2019.\n\nThe bulletin can be accessed online at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/ air/air-quality/air-advisories\n\nBe informed:\n\n- During a wildfire, smoke conditions can change quickly over short distances and can vary considerably hour-by-hour.\n\n- Wildfire smoke is a natural part of our environment but it is important to be mindful that exposure to smoke may affect your health.\n\n- People with pre-existing health conditions, the elderly, infants, children and sensitive individuals are more likely to experience health effects from smoke exposure.\n\n\nDuring smoky conditions:\n\nFollow your common sense\n- Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes difficult or you feel unwell.\n- Stay cool and drink plenty of fluids.\n-\tCarry any rescue medications with you at all times.\n-\tMake sure that children and others who cannot care for themselves follow the same advice.\n\nMonitor your symptoms\nDifferent people have different responses to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears.\n\n- People with asthma or other chronic illness should activate the personal care plans they have designed with their family physicians.\n-\tIf you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC at 8-1-1.\n-\tIf you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your health care provider, walk-in clinic, or emergency department. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\n\nTips to reduce your exposure:\n- Smoke levels may be lower indoors but will still be elevated, so stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.\n-\tRunning a commercially available HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter can improve indoor air quality in the room where the device is located.\n-\tIf you have a forced air heating/cooling system in your home, it may help to change the filter and set the fan to run continuously.\n-\tReduce indoor air pollution sources such as smoking, burning incense, and frying foods.\n-\tConsider going to a library, community center, or shopping mall with cooler filtered air to get some relief from the smoke.\n- If travelling in a car with air conditioning, keep the windows up and the ventilation set to recirculate.\n- If you are very sensitive to smoke, consider moving to another location with cleaner air, but be aware that conditions can change rapidly.\n-\tMaintaining good overall health is a good way to prevent health effects resulting from short-term exposure to air pollution.\n\nMore information\nFor general information about wildfire smoke and your health, contact HealthLink BC:\n- Phone 8-1-1 (toll free, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week), or\nCheck the Wildfires and Your Health webpage at https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-feature/wildfires.\n- The current Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and other air quality information is available at the BC Air Quality website, http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/bcairquality/readings/aqhi-table.xml.\n-\tForecasts of smoke levels over the next 48 hours are available from the Environment and Climate Change Canada FireWork prediction system, https://weather.gc.ca/firework/index_e.html.\n-\tIf you need to work outdoors in smoky conditions, material can be found at the WorkSafe BC Wildfire FAQ website, https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/ health-safety/information-sheets/wildfire-smoke-frequently-asked-questions-faq.\n-\tFirst Nations Health Authority: http://www.fnha.ca/what-we-do/environmental-health/ wildfire-information\n-\tInterior Health Authority: For resources related to forest fire smoke exposure, air quality, food safety when the power is out and ensuring your drinking water is safe visit http://www.interiorhealth.ca (Environment Tab/Emergency Information).\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-06-02T00:35:56-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
