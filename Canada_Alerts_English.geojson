				"Summary" : "Description: South Okanagan, including Penticton, Summerland, Naramata, Keremeos, Oliver and Osoyoos, will be impacted by wildfire smoke over the next 24-48 hours.\n\nDuring a wildfire, smoke conditions can change quickly over short distances and can vary considerably hour-by-hour. \n\nWildfire smoke is a natural part of our environment but it is  important to be mindful that exposure to smoke may affect your health.\n\nPeople with pre-existing health conditions, the elderly, pregnant women and  infants,  children,  and  sensitive individuals are more likely to experience health effects from smoke exposure.\n\nThe bulletin can be accessed online at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/\nair/air-quality/air-advisories.\n\nThe next bulletin update will be available August 07, 2019.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-08-08T23:59:20-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hot Spell for the Southern Interior continues today...\n\nA ridge of high pressure originating from the desert U.S. has set up shop over the BC interior. The spell of hot weather associated with the ridge will continue today.\n\nCommunities will see daytime highs soar into mid-30s again this afternoon. The public is encouraged to protect themselves from the heat. \n- Drink plenty of water even before you feel thirsty and stay in a cool place.\n- Schedule outdoor activities during the coolest parts of the day.\n- Never leave people or pets inside a parked vehicle.\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada's criteria for issuing a Heat Warning requires maximum temperatures greater than 35C and overnight lows greater than 18C for two or more consecutive days. Many locales will reach or exceed the 35C high temperature threshold but most areas will drop below 18C at night. \n\nA reprieve from the heat will begin on Friday. The transition to more seasonal temperatures will be accompanied by thunderstorms.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
