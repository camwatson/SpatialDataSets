				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls are expected. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nSnow squall warnings are issued when bands of snow form that produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to QCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #QCStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-11-09T01:56:31-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-11-08T09:56:31-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2632303603.2019<br>Area: James Bay and La Grande River",
