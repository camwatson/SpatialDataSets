The thunderstorm that gave nickel sized hail to Elie is now weakening, so any severe thunderstorms should pass to the southwest of Winnipeg. All thunderstorms are tracking east to southeast at 20 to 30 km/h. Golf ball sized hail was reported on the thunderstorm southeast of Portage La Prairie. Localized flooding is also a concern due to the slow motion of these thunderstorms.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.
