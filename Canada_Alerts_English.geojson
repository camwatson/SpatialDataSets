Large hail, torrential downpours and damaging wind gusts will be associated with the strongest of these thunderstorms.\n\nThe threat of severe weather will begin to push eastward tonight as the low pressure system evolves.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The system will funnel rain onto the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nBC South Peace River\nShowers will begin to fall over the BC South Peace River Region including Dawson Creek and Chetwynd by this afternoon. These showers will slowly transition into rain by Wednesday morning and rain, heavy at times, by Wednesday night.  The rain, heavy at times, will taper off on Thursday morning, but showers will persist into Friday.  \n\nBC North Peace River\nFor BC North Peace River, including Fort St. John, the showers will start midday Wednesday. The light rain will change to rain, heavy at times, by mid afternoon and continue until Thursday evening.\n\nFort Nelson Region\nSouthern portions of the Fort Nelson Region can expect periods of rain to continue from tonight through Friday with heavier rain falling early Thursday morning.  The community of Fort Nelson will see isolated showers until early Thursday morning when rain, heavy at times, will begin. This rain will taper off early Thursday afternoon.\n\nRainfall warnings may be issued as the system further develops and confidence in rainfall amounts increases.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
