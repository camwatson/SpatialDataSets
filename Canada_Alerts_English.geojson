However, near Kootenay Pass snow is expected to continue with snowfall amounts of 20 to 25 cm expected by Friday morning.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: AIR QUALITY ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR SMITHERS\n\n(January 22, 2020 - Smithers) The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Northern Health and the Town of Smithers has issued an Air Quality Advisory for Smithers because of high concentrations of fine particulate matter. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted.   Staying indoors and in air conditioned spaces helps to reduce fine particulate exposure.  Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nFor the duration of this advisory the use of woodstoves is prohibited within the Town of Smithers, unless the woodstove is the only source of heat in a dwelling. Real-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at: \n\nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-01-24T07:39:58-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
