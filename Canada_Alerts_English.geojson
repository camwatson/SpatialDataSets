				"Summary" : "Description: Poor visibility in snow and blowing snow is expected or occurring in some locations.\n\nA strong arctic cold front will work its way across the prairies later this afternoon and this evening. As it crosses the region strong northerly winds, gusting up to 70 km/h, will combine with falling snow to create poor visibilities in blowing snow. Near blizzard condition may be possible at times especially late this afternoon and early this evening in open areas. \n\nIn addition to the strong winds, heavy snowfall is also expected. However the heaviest snowfall is expected to fall north of the Trans-Canada and Yellowhead highways where 15 to 25 cm is likely by Wednesday morning. South and along the Trans-Canada Highway snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 are possible. Conditions throughout the region are expected to improve overnight into Wednesday morning.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nBlowing snow advisories are issued when winds are expected to create blowing snow giving poor visibility to 800 metres or less for at least 3 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Poor visibility in snow and blowing snow is expected or occurring in some locations.\n\nTotal snowfall: 2 to 4 cm in Nain, near 10 cm in Natuashish.\n\nMaximum wind gusts: northwesterly 100 km/h.\n\nTime span: tonight.\n\nRemarks: Fresh snowfall will combine with strengthening northwesterly winds tonight to produce poor visibility in blowing snow, especially in the Natuashish area. Conditions are expected to improve slightly on Wednesday morning as the snow tapers off.  However, winds gusting as high as 80 km/h may continue to produce poor visibility in blowing snow over exposed areas for much of Wednesday.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlowing snow advisories are issued when winds are expected to create blowing snow giving poor visibility to 800 metres or less for at least 3 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to NLstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #NLwx.<br>Expires: 2020-12-23T01:21:42-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-12-22T09:21:42-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.4141170468.2020<br>Area: Nain and vicinity",

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nWinter storm to affect southern Manitoba beginning this morning. Storm total snowfall will be between 10 to 25 cm by Wednesday morning.\n\nA strong low pressure system will track along the international border today, bringing heavy snow, strong winds, and blowing snow to southern Manitoba. Snow is expected to begin in the southwest this morning and spread north and  eastward throughout the day and continue into Wednesday morning. A swath of 15 to 25 cm is likely north of the Trans-Canada and Yellowhead Highways and south of an east to west extending from Swan River to Bissett.\n\nIn addition to the snow, strong northerly winds, with gusts of 70 km/h, will develop with this system throughout today into tonight. The strongest winds will be in the Interlake and Red River valley. This will lead to visibility reductions in blowing snow lasting into Wednesday afternoon.\n\nConditions will improve from west to east overnight into Wednesday as the system departs the province.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Rapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Significant snowfall is expected this evening through Wednesday.\n\nSnow will begin this evening and continue into Wednesday. Snow will gradually taper to flurries from west to east on Thursday afternoon.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts of 15 to 25 cm are expected by Thursday afternoon. Locally higher amounts near 30 cm are possible.\n\nBrisk northerly winds gusting 50 to 60 km/h late Wednesday afternoon and into Thursday will result in localized blowing snow over exposed areas.\n\nDriving conditions will quickly deteriorate this evening as the snow begins. Motorists should consider changing travel plans accordingly.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-12-23T01:54:36-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-12-22T09:54:36-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1852196610.2020<br>Area: Nipigon - Rossport, Marathon - Schreiber",

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nWinter storm to affect southern Saskatchewan today. Storm total snowfall will be between 10-25 cm. \n\nA strong low pressure system will track along the International border today bringing heavy snow to a portion of southern Saskatchewan. Snow began overnight in southwest and south central Saskatchewan and will spread eastward to the Manitoba border this morning. A swath of 15 to 25 cm is expected through this  evening, generally centred between the Trans-Canada and Yellowhead Highways. \n\nAlong with the heavy snow, strong northerly winds gusting up to 60 km/h are expected to develop with this system, leading to a visibility reduction in blowing snow. The strong winds will first develop over western sections this morning and track eastward through the day. \n\nThere is also a risk of freezing rain over areas near the Trans-Canada Hwy and south toward the international border. Patchy freezing rain will begin over western sections early this morning and track eastward through the day.\n\nConditions will improve from west to east late this afternoon and tonight.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Snow may mix with rain along the shoreline of Lake Superior on Wednesday morning and into early Wednesday afternoon as temperatures briefly rise above the freezing mark. As a result, lesser snowfall accumulations are anticipated near Lake Superior.\n\nBrisk northerly winds gusting 40 to 60 km/h on Wednesday will result in localized blowing snow over exposed areas.\n\nDriving conditions will quickly deteriorate by this evening as the snow begins. Motorists should consider changing travel plans accordingly.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.
