				"Summary" : "Description: Lake effect snow squalls expected Wednesday.\n\nSoutherly winds over the relatively warm waters of Lake Superior are expected to produce flurries and local snow squalls on Wednesday. The squalls could start as early as Wednesday morning and are expected to continue through Wednesday night. \n\nLocal snowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm are possible on Wednesday, however areas closer to Lake Superior could see locally higher amounts of 15 to 25 cm. Additional amounts of 5 to 15 cm are possible Wednesday night into Thursday morning.\n\nLocal blowing snow reducing visibilities will also be a concern. \n\nLocal snow squalls are forecast to taper off when the winds shift to the northwest on Thursday.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
