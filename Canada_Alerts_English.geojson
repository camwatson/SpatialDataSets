Strong northwesterly winds gusting between 70 and 90 km/h will persist through tonight and Boxing Day and will combine with the fresh snowfall to cause reduced visibilities in blowing snow, especially in exposed areas.\n\n###\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
