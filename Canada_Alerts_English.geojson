				"Summary" : "Description: ROAD DUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR SMITHERS AND VERNON\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Northern Health has continued a Road Dust Advisory because of high concentrations of coarse particulate matter that are expected to persist until there is precipitation or dust suppression.  Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted.  Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at  https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-03-23T22:21:06-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

				"Summary" : "Description: A long period of snowfall with total amounts of 10 to 15 cm is expected.\n\nSnow will continue to push into Alberta today as a low pressure system develops in central Alberta. Snow will fall throughout the day today, before finally tapering off early Tuesday morning.\n\nFor the Whitecourt region, areas north of Whitecourt are expected to receive snowfall totals of 10 to 15 cm whereas areas to the south, are not expected to receive such high totals.\n\nAreas near Hinton won't see heavier snowfall until later this afternoon.\n\nThis warning may need to be expanded to other regions as the system continues to develop.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
