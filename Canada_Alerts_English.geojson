For Wawa and areas near the shoreline of Lake Superior, snow amounts may be less than 10 cm due to a mix of wet snow and rain last night.\n\nBrisk southwesterly winds with gusts to 60 km/h are expected late this morning that may result in localized blowing snow.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.
