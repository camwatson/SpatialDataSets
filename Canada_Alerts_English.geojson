Showers, heavy at times have been observed in some areas today. Radar indicates 2 primary areas of concern: \n\nThe first is over the western portion of the province, where a very slow moving band of moderate to heavy precipitation could bring in excess of 50 mm of rainfall by tonight.\n\nThe second area of concern is over Guysborough county and portions of Cape Breton Island. Total rainfall amounts for some of these regions may exceed 50 mm by Monday afternoon.\n\nDue to the high degree of uncertainty in forecast guidance, and the movement of some of the heaviest bands of rain, the statement has been issued for the entire province.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
