				"Summary" : "Description: Potentially damaging winds tonight.\n\nAn Alberta Clipper will continue to bring moderate winds gusting between 60 and 70 km/h early this evening. Winds will then strengthen later this evening with gusts up to 90 km/h. Winds will diminish Monday morning.\n\nIn addition, flurries will develop off of Lake Huron and Georgian Bay this evening. Strong winds along with the falling snow will reduce visibilities at times and make travel difficult. Flurries will end early Monday morning.\n\n###\n\nDamage to buildings, such as to roof shingles and windows, may occur. High winds may toss loose objects or cause tree branches to break.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA prolonged period of snow, ice pellets, and freezing rain is expected to begin early Sunday evening and end Monday afternoon.\n\nThe heaviest snow is expected to fall near the Alberta-N.W.T. border, with total accumulations of 10-15 cm possible. \n\nA persistent band of freezing rain and ice pellets is expected to form south of the snow.  There is uncertainty on the exact location of the band of freezing rain, but current indications suggest it will be mainly south of Highway 58.   Freezing rain amounts will be highly variable, but could range from 1-5 mm.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
