				"Summary" : "Description: Humidex values reaching 38 are expected.\n\nA prolonged period of hot weather continues over portions of southern and east-central Manitoba.\n\nSoutherly winds are spreading hot and increasingly humid weather into Manitoba. Daytime highs will climb into the low thirties with overnight lows rising into the upper teens or low twenties.\n\nThese hot temperatures will be joined by humid conditions next week which will increase humidex values into the upper thirties. Notably, the high humidity will likely result in several nights of overnight minimum temperatures in the low twenties. The heat will begin to break through the latter half of the week.\n\nOn Sunday in southwestern Manitoba, a strong cold front will produce a sharp temperature change from highs in the low thirties to its east to highs in the mid-twenties to its west. There is a chance that this front will slide east of Brandon and the Turtle Mountains; if it does those areas may see an early reprieve from the heat.\n\nFor most regions in the heat warning, daytime highs will dip a couple degrees on Monday into the upper twenties. Overnight lows will not be impacted by this and daytime highs will climb back into the low thirties for Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n###\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nFor more information on heat and your health:\n- Visit Manitoba Health at: http://www.manitoba.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/heat.html. \n- Call Health Links – Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Humidex values reaching 38 are expected.\n\nA prolonged period of hot weather continues over portions of southern and east-central Manitoba.\n\nSoutherly winds are spreading hot and increasingly humid weather into Manitoba. Daytime highs will climb into the low thirties with overnight lows rising into the upper teens or low twenties.\n\nThese hot temperatures will be joined by humid conditions next week which will increase humidex values into the upper thirties. Notably, the high humidity will likely result in several nights of overnight minimum temperatures in the low twenties. The heat will begin to break through the latter half of the week.\n\nOn Sunday in southwestern Manitoba, a strong cold front will produce a sharp temperature change from highs in the low thirties to its east to highs in the mid-twenties to its west. There is a chance that this front will slide east of Brandon and the Turtle Mountains; if it does those areas may see an early reprieve from the heat.\n\nFor most regions in the heat warning, daytime highs will dip a couple degrees on Monday into the upper twenties. Overnight lows will not be impacted by this and daytime highs will climb back into the low thirties for Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n###\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nFor more information on heat and your health:\n- Visit Manitoba Health at: http://www.manitoba.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/heat.html. \n- Call Health Links – Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
