				"Summary" : "Description: A late season snowfall in store for some regions of the province.\n\nTotal snowfall: up to 10 cm for some areas, possibly more especially over the Cape Breton Highlands..\n\nMaximum wind gusts: 70 to 90 km/h, \n\nLocation: northern and western Nova Scotia.\n\nTime span: tonight into Sunday.\n\nRemarks: Periods of snow and strong winds are expected to develop this evening over western Nova Scotia where westerly winds blow onshore. These conditions are forecast to spread eastward across northern Nova Scotia later tonight, reaching the Cape Breton Highlands during the overnight hours. Conditions will improve Sunday morning over western areas of the province, and later in the morning or in the afternoon over eastern regions.\n\nLarge waves, pounding surf and elevated sea levels are expected. \n\nLocations: the Nova Scotia coastline of the Bay of Fundy, including the Minas Basin.\n\nTime Span: from 11:00 p.m. this evening to 3:00 am on Sunday.\n\nRemarks: An intensifying low pressure system will pass just north of Nova Scotia today. This will give storm surge combined with waves approaching the Fundy coast of the province from the west, as well as large spring tides this weekend. The combined effects may cause minor flooding. If the storm track or intensity changes, storm surge warnings may be required.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
