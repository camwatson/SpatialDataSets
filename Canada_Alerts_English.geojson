Cold Arctic air over the BC interior will continue to flow towards the BC coast. \n\nTemperatures over Interior regions will be 10 to 20 degrees below the seasonal average, while coastal areas will be 5 to 10 degrees below seasonal, making for the coldest conditions seen this season. \n\nThe cold air will persist for the remainder of the week. In addition, Arctic Outflow warnings are possible for the Fraser Valley, the Sea to Sky corridor and the Central Coast beginning Wednesday night as wind chill values approach minus 20.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The snow combined with strong northwesterly winds will cause reduced visibilities in blowing snow. \n\nConditions will improve early Tuesday morning for areas along the south coast as the snow tapers to flurries; however, strong northwesterly winds will persist into Tuesday afternoon which may cause reduced visibility in blowing snow over some areas. Strong northwesterly winds and periods of snow will persist over more northern areas, including the St. John's Metro area, throughout the night and into the day Tuesday before tapering to onshore flurries.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.
