An atmospheric river will take aim at Vancouver Island beginning early this morning delivering heavy rain and mild conditions until mid-day Sunday. The heaviest rainfall is expected to be near northshore where 40 to 50 mm are possible by Sunday morning. \n\nGiven the tropical origin of the atmospheric river, freezing levels will be on the rise upwards of 3000 metres for the South Coast. The mild air will result in rain at almost all elevations. High runoff and rising river levels are likely through the weekend. \n\nThe public is encouraged to monitor rainfall and wind warnings from Environment and Climate Change Canada as well as potential high streamflow advisories or flood watches from the BC River Forecast Centre.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Rainfall amounts of 100 to 120 mm are expected by Sunday morning for the aforementioned regions.\n\nGiven the tropical origin of the atmospheric river, freezing levels will be on the rise upwards of 3000 metres for the South Coast and close to 2500 metres for the North Coast. The mild air will result in rain at almost all elevations. High runoff and rising river levels are likely through the weekend.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
