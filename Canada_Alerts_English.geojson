				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nA low pressure trough pushing through southern Manitoba today combined with a warm and humid airmass has triggered thunderstorms. Some of these will likely be severe during the late afternoon and evening hours as they track eastward. \n\nThe airmass over portions of western Manitoba has stabilized enough that the watch has been lifted between Dauphin and Melita.\n\n###\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-18T06:59:13-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-17T20:25:13-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2371122528.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Elton incl.
