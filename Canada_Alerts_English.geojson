				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms this evening.\n\nThunderstorms have formed in Saskatchewan, Montana, and North Dakota. Some of these thunderstorms have the potential to become severe with hail to the size of golf balls, wind gusts in excess of 100 km/h, and rainfall in excess of 100 mm.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-06-30T10:39:38-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-30T03:41:38-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2340052116.2020<br>Area: Mun. of Grassland incl.

				"Summary" : "Description: Update: This is a Manitoba Emergency Alert. Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre has issued a Flood Warning for southwestern, western and central regions of Manitoba. A weather system may release 80 to 150 millimetres of rain in these areas in between June 29 to July 1. Areas in southwest Manitoba, including Virden and Brandon could see up to 175 millimetres of rain during this time.\n\nIf you are in the affected area, be watchful as local waterways are expected to rise quickly and may cause flooding. There is a potential for overland flooding in low lying areas. Do not attempt to cross fast flowing waters or waters of unknown depth. Use caution when driving on all roads as road conditions may have changed. Avoid flooded areas. Follow all directions by local authorities, listen for updates and take all necessary precautions to stay safe. Stay tuned to local media for updates.<br>Expires: 2020-07-02T16:00:00-05:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Manitoba Emergency Measures Organization, 2020-06-29T16:04:24-05:00, 3A3AE419-65C3-7512-7AD7-C114C3069427<br>Area: Southwestern, Western and Central Manitoba",

Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
