Along this zone, several hours of freezing rain may be possible, favouring ice build up on untreated surfaces and power lines. Precipitation will likely include a mix of rain, snow, ice pellets, and freezing rain. Snowfall accumulations are generally anticipated to be limited to 5 cm or less. \n\nFreezing Rain Warnings will be considered as this event draws nearer.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The snow is expected to mix with rain along parts of the coast. Eastern regions will generally get 5 to 10 cm, with higher local amounts over higher terrain. Temperatures are forecast to remain slightly above the freezing mark throughout the event. As a result, driving conditions are expected to be hazardous, especially during the morning commute, as the settling snow will become slushy on the roads and walkways.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The snow may change briefly to freezing rain or ice pellets over south-central parts of the province on Saturday night. Coastal regions along the Fundy shore should remain warm enough for rain with this system. There is some uncertainty with the track of this system at this time. The rain-snow line may shift slightly and warnings may be required as this system draws nearer.\n\nConditions will improve across the Maritimes on Monday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
