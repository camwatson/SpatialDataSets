These thunderstorms are capable of producing quarter sized hail, damaging winds in excess of 90 km/h and brief heavy downpours.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, damaging hail and heavy rain.\n\nVery warm and humid air combined with a low pressure trough has triggered thunderstorms with some severe storms over western Saskatchewan this evening. These storms will continue tracking eastward tonight. Strong winds and heavy rain will be the main threat from these storms.\n\n###\n\nStrong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to SKstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #SKStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-07-15T13:59:22-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-15T04:01:22-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3631470386.2019<br>Area: City of Regina, R.M. of Maple Bush including Riverhurst and Douglas Prov.
