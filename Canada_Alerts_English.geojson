This combination will result in near zero visibility in blowing snow and extreme wind chill values.\n\nThe strong outflow winds are expected to moderate this afternoon, but periods of heavy snow will continue tonight into Sunday.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be extremely hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least 4 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
