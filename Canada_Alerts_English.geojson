				"Summary" : "Description: Potential for a wintry mix of freezing rain and heavy snow beginning Wednesday afternoon.\n\nA strong low pressure system will track across Saskatchewan Wednesday, giving a swath of freezing rain and heavy snow from Meadow Lake eastward into Manitoba. Freezing rain will begin over the Alberta border Wednesday morning and track toward the Manitoba border in the afternoon. The freezing rain will switch over to heavy snow Wednesday afternoon and last into Thursday morning. Snowfall totals will be in the 10-20 cm range by time the heavy snow tapers off Thursday morning.\n\nWinter Storm Warnings have been issued for areas west of this watch. Those warnings may be expanded to these watched regions as the system develops.\n\nThis low pressure system is also affecting areas to the south with strong northwesterly winds and blowing snow. The strong winds, with gusts of 90-110 km/h, and blowing snow will begin over southwestern sections of the province Wednesday afternoon and track toward the southeast by Wednesday evening.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nWinter storm watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to SKstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #SKStorm.<br>Expires: 2021-01-13T14:11:47-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2021-01-12T22:12:47-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0887880686.2021<br>Area: Hwy 135 including Pelican Narrows and Sandy Bay, Seabee Mine, Hanson Lake Road east of Hwy 135 including Creighton, Hanson Lake Road between Hwys 165 and 135, Cumberland House",

				"Summary" : "Description: Potential for a wintry mix of freezing rain and heavy snow beginning Wednesday afternoon.\n\nA strong low pressure system will track across Saskatchewan Wednesday, giving a swath of freezing rain and heavy snow from Meadow Lake eastward into Manitoba. Freezing rain will begin over the Alberta border Wednesday morning and track toward the Manitoba border in the afternoon. The freezing rain will switch over to heavy snow Wednesday afternoon and last into Thursday morning. Snowfall totals will be in the 10-20 cm range by time the heavy snow tapers off Thursday morning.\n\nWinter Storm Warnings have been issued for areas west of this watch. Those warnings may be expanded to these watched regions as the system develops.\n\nThis low pressure system is also affecting areas to the south with strong northwesterly winds and blowing snow. The strong winds, with gusts of 90-110 km/h, and blowing snow will begin over southwestern sections of the province Wednesday afternoon and track toward the southeast by Wednesday evening.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nWinter storm watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Strong winds with severe and damaging gusts are expected or occurring.\n\nStrong west to northwest winds, with gusts of 110 km/h beginning Wednesday afternoon. \n\nA strong low pressure system will track across Saskatchewan Wednesday. Over southwestern sections, strong winds will develop toward noon and track eastward throughout the day. There may also be blowing snow at times from the combination of falling snow and the strong winds, which can create periods of reduced visibilities. The strong winds will subside below warning criteria Wednesday evening, but will remain blustery into Thursday evening. \n\nThis system will be affecting much of Saskatchewan, with heavy snow further north, and the potential for prolonged blowing snow to the east toward the Manitoba border.\n\n###\n\nDamage to buildings, such as to roof shingles and windows, may occur. Drivers may lose control of their vehicles; tall vehicles are at risk of being overturned.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Precipitation will begin as freezing rain Wednesday morning over the northern grainbelt before switching to heavy snow in the afternoon. Snowfall totals with this system will be in the 10-15 cm range by time the heavy snow tapers off Wednesday night.\n\nThese winter storm warnings may be expanded as the system develops.\n\nThis system will also be affecting areas south of the winter storm warning with strong winds and blowing snow. West to northwest winds, with gusts of 90-110 km/h, will affect much of southern Saskatchewan, beginning Wednesday afternoon over the southwest and into the south central and southeast Wednesday night.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and hazardous.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
