Cooler northwest winds will develop in its wake and cause the rain to switch over to snow near or after midnight. Snowfall amounts of up to 10 cm are possible by Sunday morning. The exact amount of snow will depend on the track of this low. If the low's track is further north then the rain will persist longer into the night.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
