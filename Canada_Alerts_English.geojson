As well, over northern Manitoba, this morning, some regions may see freezing rain mixed in with the snow.\n\nConditions will gradually improve later this morning and through the afternoon.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Ice build-up may cause tree branches to break.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA potent winter storm is bringing heavy snow, wind, and freezing rain to parts of Saskatchewan and Manitoba.\n\nA powerful Colorado Low will move through the Prairies tonight. Moderate to heavy snow will spread northeastwards through Saskatchewan tonight and continue on Monday across Manitoba. Snowfall totals as high as 30 to 50 cm are expected. Moderate northerly winds will develop and produce periods of reduced visibility in blowing snow overnight. Some regions will also see a mix of snow and freezing rain; consult local forecasts for more details on the location and timing.\n\nConditions will gradually improve from southwest to northeast later overnight through Monday.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Ice build-up may cause tree branches to break.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nSnow at times heavy will continue tonight in southern Alberta before ending west to east overnight and into Monday morning. Total snowfall accumulations will range between 20 to 40 cm, with locally higher amounts over higher terrain in the Crowsnest Pass region and near the Cypress Hills.\n\nAdditionally, strong northerly winds with gusts as high as 60-80 km/h will persist and produce widespread blowing snow with sudden whiteout conditions early this evening for much of southeastern Alberta. The strong winds are expected to diminish later this evening.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Total snowfall accumulations will range between 20 to 40 cm, with locally higher amounts near the Cypress Hills.\n\nAdditionally, strong northerly winds with gusts as high as 70 km/h will persist and produce widespread blowing snow with sudden whiteout conditions this evening in southeastern Alberta. The strong winds are expected to diminish overnight.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Total snowfall accumulations will range between 20 to 40 cm, with locally higher amounts near the Cypress Hills.\n\nAdditionally, strong northerly winds with gusts as high as 70 km/h will persist and produce widespread blowing snow with sudden whiteout conditions this evening in southeastern Alberta. The strong winds are expected to diminish overnight.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult.
