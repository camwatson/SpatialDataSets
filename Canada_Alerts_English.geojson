				"Summary" : "Description: A sloppy Friday morning commute is expected.\n\nTotal snowfall: 5 to 10 cm, with potentially greater amounts along the eastern shore.\n\nLocations: Avalon Peninsula.\n\nTime span: early Friday morning until early Friday evening.\n\nMaximum wind gusts: northeasterly 60 to 70 km/h.\n\nRemarks: A low pressure system is expected to pass southeast of the island on Friday. Snow will begin early Friday morning and potentially mix with rain along parts of the coast. Temperatures are forecast to remain slightly above the freezing mark throughout the event. As a result, driving conditions are expected to be hazardous, especially during the morning commute, as the settling snow will become slushy on the roads and walkways.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
