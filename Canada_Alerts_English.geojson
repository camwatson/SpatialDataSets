				"Summary" : "Description: 5 to 15 cm of snow and ice pellets, plus a risk of freezing rain, is expected this weekend. \n\nHazards: \n5 to 15 cm of snow and ice pellets; up to 20 cm may be possible for places like Parry Sound and Huntsville\nPoor road conditions due to accumulating snow and possible freezing rain\n\nTiming: \nSnow will begin Friday overnight and last into Sunday. \n\nDiscussion:\nAn approaching system will spread precipitation across Georgian Bay and east to the Ottawa River beginning Friday overnight. The track of this low will determine how the precipitation falls, whether it be as snow, ice pellets, or possibly even freezing rain, but right now a general range of 5 to 15 cm of snow and ice pellets seems reasonable with a risk of freezing rain. A slight shift south in the track could mean up to 20 cm of snow is possible in places like Huntsville and Parry Sound. Environment Canada meteorologists will continue to monitor this developing situation.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow, ice pellets, and a prolonged period of freezing rain is possible this weekend. \n\nHazards: \nFreezing rain, possibly lasting several hours\n3-8 mm of ice accretion\nLocal power outages and slippery surfaces\n\nTiming: \nPrecipitation will begin Saturday morning and last into Sunday. \n\nDiscussion:\nAn approaching system will bring a transition zone of precipitation with it from roughly the Dundalk Highlands east to Ottawa and eastern Ontario. Along this zone, several hours of freezing rain may be possible, favouring ice build up on untreated surfaces and power lines. Precipitation will likely include a mix of rain, snow, ice pellets, and freezing rain. Snowfall accumulations are generally anticipated to be limited to 5 cm or less. A Freezing Rain Warning will be considered as this event draws nearer.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
