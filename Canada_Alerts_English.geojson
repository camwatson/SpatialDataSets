A second round of heavy snow is expected to set in during the morning of Boxing Day.\n\nGusty northeasterly winds will strengthen to strong northwesterlies with gusts to 80 km/h overnight. The strong northwesterlies will then persist through Boxing Day.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
