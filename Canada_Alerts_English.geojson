				"Summary" : "Description: High levels of air pollution due to smoke from forest fires will continue into tonight. \n\nSmoke plumes are moving over the region from several forest fires located in the Sandy Lake - Pikangikum region. Light northerly winds from last night have resulted in the smoke plumes affecting areas to the south and southeast of these fires. Winds will become light southwesterly tonight which will direct smoke plumes to the northeast and east. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\nThese smoke plumes will continue to affect the region tonight and Monday morning. For communities north and east of the Sandy Lake - Pikangikum region the plumes will continue through the day Monday. \n\nIf you, or someone in your care, develop symptoms, reduce or reschedule strenuous outdoors activities where ever possible until the air quality improves.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-08T18:46:51-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-08T02:47:51-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2356014249.2019<br>Area: Attawapiskat, Sachigo Lake - Bearskin Lake, Big Trout Lake - Kasabonika, Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake, Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell, Summer Beaver - Wunnummin Lake - Kingfisher Lake, Pickle Lake - Cat Lake, Webequie, Fort Hope - Lansdowne House - Ogoki, Red Lake - Woodland Caribou Park, Ear Falls - Perrault Falls - Western Lac Seul, Savant Lake - Sturgeon Lake, Sioux Lookout - Eastern Lac Seul, Kenora - Grassy Narrows - Whitedog, Sioux Narrows - Nestor Falls - Morson, Dryden - Vermilion Bay, Ignace - English River, Fort Frances - Emo - Rainy River, Seine River Village - Mine Centre, Armstrong - Auden - Wabakimi Park, Gull Bay - Black Sturgeon Lake, Upsala - Raith, Atikokan - Shebandowan - Quetico Park, Cloud Bay - Dorion, Kakabeka Falls - Whitefish Lake - Arrow Lake",

Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2019-07-08T05:37:09-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-08T02:39:09-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3184556621.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Meadow Lake including Waterhen Res., R.M. of Loon Lake including Loon Lake and Makwa, R.M. of Frenchman Butte including St. Walburg",
