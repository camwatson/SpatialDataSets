Wednesday morning to Wednesday evening for Halifax County - East of Porters Lake to Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County.\n\nRemarks: An approaching low pressure system is now expected to track further south of Nova Scotia than previously forecast on Tuesday night and Wednesday. Snow is still forecast to begin over southwestern Nova Scotia Tuesday afternoon and then spread eastward, reaching Cape Breton on Wednesday morning. However, total snowfall is now only expected to approach 10 cm over the South Shore from Yarmouth to Lunenburg Counties. \n\nDue to the uncertainty which remains in the forecast track, the snowfall forecast may be revised as the system approaches. In any case, this snowfall event has the potential to create difficult driving conditions in some areas during the Wednesday morning commute.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Tuesday morning.\n\nRemarks: Storm surge and minor coastal flooding is possible along shorelines exposed to the west, especially near high tide tonight.  Although tonight's high tide is not expected to be as high as the tide earlier this afternoon, the stronger winds and higher waves are expected to have similar impacts as experienced today.  Water levels will begin to subside Tuesday morning as the tide drops.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The combination of these winds and the current run of high amplitude tides could produce breaking sea conditions along the coast near the following localities, on the dates and at the times specified (Eastern Standard Time).\n\n\nRimouski - Mont-Joli:\n2019-12-16, from 3 PM to 7 PM.\n\n\nMatane:\n2019-12-16, from 3 PM to 7 PM.\n\n###\n\nHigh waves combined with the surge may cause damage along the coast.
