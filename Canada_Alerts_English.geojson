Blowing snow may also impact sections of Highway 11 west of Nordegg.\n\n###\n\nDamage to buildings, such as to roof shingles and windows, may occur. High winds may toss loose objects or cause tree branches to break.\n\nWind warnings are issued when there is a significant risk of damaging winds.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Strong winds, gusting up to 100 km/h will continue today.\n\nThe strongest wind gusts will be in wind prone areas and will persist through the day today before easing off tonight. \n\nIn Banff and Jasper National Parks, including the Icefields Parkway, snow will accompany these strong winds resulting in locally poor visibility in blowing snow.  Blowing snow may also impact sections of Highway 11 west of Nordegg.\n\n###\n\nDamage to buildings, such as to roof shingles and windows, may occur. High winds may toss loose objects or cause tree branches to break.\n\nWind warnings are issued when there is a significant risk of damaging winds.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
