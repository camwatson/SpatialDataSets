Strong northerly winds and blowing snow can be expected in the Hopedale area on Saturday but these winds won't reach the Postville - Makkovik area until Saturday evening. Conditions will improve on Sunday.\n\nThere is still some uncertainty as to how fast the system causing these conditions will track southward along the Labrador coast which will impact the snowfall duration and thus the snowfall amounts.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nWinter storm watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls are expected to develop. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nSnow squalls are expected to develop. Under snow squall bands visibility can be reduced due to heavy snow and blowing snow, and snow can quickly accumulate.\n\nTotal snowfall: locally 5 to possibly 15 cm in the most intense squalls.\n\nMaximum wind gusts: 50-60 km/h.\n\nLocations: West coast of Cape Breton and over the Highlands.\n\nTimespan: This afternoon into this evening, and Saturday afternoon into the evening.\n\nRemarks: Areas along the west coast and over the Highlands are at highest threat, with the intensity likely to be highest today. Early on Saturday, the winds and snow will diminish but will again increase Saturday afternoon into the evening. Total snowfall amounts may reach 20 cm.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
