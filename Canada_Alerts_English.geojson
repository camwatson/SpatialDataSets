				"Summary" : "Description: For Tropical Depression Erin.\n\nThe next information statement will be issued by 09:00 a.m. ADT.\n\nTropical Depression Erin is tracking northeastward toward the Maritimes. Erin is expected to transition to a post-tropical system well before it reaches southwestern Nova Scotia this evening. Erin will bring heavy rain to much of the region today, and strong gusty winds to parts of Nova Scotia tonight.\n\n\n1. Summary of basic information at 03:00 a.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: Near 36.2 North 71.9 West.\n\nAbout distance 345 kilometres east-northeast of Cape Hatteras NC.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 56 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: North-northeast at 33 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 1004 millibars.\n\n\n2. Public weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nTropical Depression Erin is expected to transition to a post-tropical system by the time it enters Canadian waters later today. Rain associated with a trough of low pressure approaching from the west will spread over the western Maritimes this morning. As Erin approaches, some of its moisture will feed into this trough and likely enhance the rain intensity associated with it. The heavier rain and strongest winds associated directly with post-tropical Erin should reach the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia later this evening or early Friday morning. \n\na. Wind.\n\nSome gusty winds will likely accompany post-tropical Erin, especially to those areas just to the right of its track as it crosses Nova Scotia later tonight. It is not expected that these winds will reach warning criteria (i.e. gusts to 90 km/h or higher), but could still be strong enough to cause isolated power outages and minor damage, especially given that trees are still in full leaf.\n\nb. Rainfall.\n\nThe combination of Post-Tropical Erin and its interaction with the trough of low pressure crossing the region today will combine to produce significant rainfall.  Rainfall will likely meet or exceed warning criteria (50 mm or more in 24 hours) in parts of the Maritimes, especially those areas just north and west of Erin's track. Some isolated locations in these areas could possibly see total rainfall amounts in excess of 100 mm before the rain ends later Friday morning. \n\nRainfall warnings are now in effect for southeastern New Brunswick and may extended to parts of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island this morning. \n\nc. Surge/Waves.\n\nSignificant storm surge and coastal impacts from high waves are not expected. After midnight into Friday morning, waves near 4 metres will spread from west to east along the Atlantic Coast of Nova Scotia and will break higher along the beaches. Rip currents could also be an issue, and the public should exercise caution near the coast.\n \n3. Marine weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nGale warnings are in effect for most Maritimes waters near and to the right of Erin's track through the marine district, where gale force southerlies up to 40 knots are possible.\n\nForecaster(s): Borgel\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-08-30T11:47:35-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-08-29T05:48:35-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0768326673.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Kouchibouguac National Park, Fundy National Park, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I.",

				"Summary" : "Description: For Post-tropical Storm Erin.\n\nThe next information statement will be issued by 09:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nErin, now a Post-tropical system, will continue tracking northeastward towards the Maritimes. Erin is bringing heavy rain to much of the region today, and strong gusty winds to parts of Nova Scotia tonight.\n\n\n1. Summary of basic information at 03:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: Near 40.2 North 68.0 West.\n\nAbout distance 431 kilometres south-southwest of Yarmouth NS.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 65 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: North-northeast at 39 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 1003 millibars.\n\n\n2. Public weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nRain associated with a trough of low pressure approaching from the west will continue to spread across the Maritimes. As Post-tropical Erin approaches, some of its moisture will feed into this trough and likely enhance the rain intensity associated with it. The heavier rain and strongest winds associated directly with Post-Tropical Erin should reach the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia later this evening or early Friday morning. \n\na. Wind.\n\nSome gusty winds will likely accompany Post-tropical Erin, especially to those areas just to the right of its track as it crosses Nova Scotia later tonight. It is not expected that these winds will reach warning criteria (i.e. gusts to 90 km/h or higher), but could still be strong enough to cause isolated power outages and minor damage, especially given that trees are still in full leaf.\n\nb. Rainfall.\n\nThe combination of Post-tropical Erin and its interaction with the trough of low pressure crossing the region today will combine to produce significant rainfall.  Rainfall will likely meet or exceed warning criteria (50 mm or more in 24 hours) in parts of the Maritimes, especially those areas just north and west of Erin's track. Some isolated locations in these areas could possibly see total rainfall amounts in excess of 100 mm before the rain ends later Friday morning. \n\nRainfall warnings are now in effect for southern New Brunswick, parts of western and northern Nova Scotia, and western Prince Edward Island. \n\nc. Surge/Waves.\n\nSignificant storm surge and coastal impacts from high waves are not expected. After midnight into Friday morning, waves near 4 metres will spread from west to east along the Atlantic Coast of Nova Scotia and will break higher along the beaches. Rip currents could also be an issue, and the public should exercise caution near the coast.\n \n3. Marine weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nGale warnings are in effect for most Maritimes waters near and to the right of Erin's track through the marine district, where gale force southerlies up to 45 knots are possible.\n\nForecaster(s): Mercer\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-08-30T23:04:46-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-08-29T17:45:46-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.4080426088.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Fredericton and Southern York County, Oromocto and Sunbury County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Kouchibouguac National Park, Fundy National Park, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I.",
