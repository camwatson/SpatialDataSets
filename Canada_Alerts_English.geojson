				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls off of Lake Superior possible on Monday.\n\nLocally heavy snow squalls are forecast to develop Monday morning as winds shift to a southwesterly direction. These snow squalls are then expected to continue into Monday night.\n\nSnowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm per 12 hours are possible Monday and Monday night.\n\nDangerous winter driving conditions will be possible Monday. Motorists are advised to adjust their travel plans accordingly.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Arctic air continues to move throughout BC.\n\nFollowing a relatively mild first half of winter, a transition to much colder conditions continues throughout BC. Cold Arctic currently over the northern BC interior will continue to filter southwards and towards the BC coast. \n\nThe Arctic air will arrive in the southern interior overnight or early Monday morning and reach the south coast Monday morning. On Tuesday, temperatures will continue to drop as more Arctic air is forced southwards. Strong outflow winds and brisk wind chill values are then expected to begin over southern coastal areas Tuesday night.\n\nTemperatures over Interior regions will be 10 to 20 degrees below the seasonal average, while coastal areas will be 5 to 10 degrees below seasonal, making for the coldest conditions seen this season.\n\nThe cold air will persist for the remainder of the week.\n\nArctic Outflow and Extreme Cold warnings are in effect for several regions in the province and may be expanded as the Arctic air progresses.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Arctic air continues to move throughout BC.\n\nFollowing a relatively mild first half of winter, a transition to much colder conditions continues throughout BC. Cold Arctic currently over the northern BC interior will continue to filter southwards and towards the BC coast. \n\nThe Arctic air will arrive in the southern interior overnight or early Monday morning and reach the south coast Monday morning. On Tuesday, temperatures will continue to drop as more Arctic air is forced southwards. Strong outflow winds and brisk wind chill values are then expected to begin over southern coastal areas Tuesday night.\n\nTemperatures over Interior regions will be 10 to 20 degrees below the seasonal average, while coastal areas will be 5 to 10 degrees below seasonal, making for the coldest conditions seen this season.\n\nThe cold air will persist for the remainder of the week.\n\nArctic Outflow and Extreme Cold warnings are in effect for several regions in the province and may be expanded as the Arctic air progresses.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
