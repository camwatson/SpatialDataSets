Some brief improvement may occur during the afternoon hours.\n\nAs an Arctic airmass descends southward across Alberta this weekend, this extreme cold warning will continue to be expanded.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nWatch for cold related symptoms: shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle pain and weakness, numbness and colour change in fingers and toes.\n\nExtreme cold warnings are issued when very cold temperatures or wind chill creates an elevated risk to health such as frost bite and hypothermia.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
