Winds will gradually diminish Sunday evening. Some snow is forecast with this system as well, which combined with the strong winds will create reduced visibilities in blowing snow. \n\nConfidence is relatively high that these significant wind gusts will materialize, but there is still some uncertainty in regards to the track of the system, so this warning may be adjusted as the system approaches. Please stay alert for updated bulletins.\n\n###\n\nDamage to buildings, such as to roof shingles and windows, may occur.
