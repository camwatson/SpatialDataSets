				"Summary" : "Description: Early August Heavy Rainfall for Vancouver Island and the South Coast of British Columbia.\n\nAn unseasonably strong Pacific frontal system is giving rain to Vancouver Island and parts of the south coast. The system is tapping into subtropical moisture which is amplifying the front and helping to enhance the rainfall.\n\nThe main area of rain has moved over Vancouver Island and the Sunshine Coast. The rain will become heavy at times this evening as the front intensifies. \n\nOver Howe Sound, Whistler, and northern sections of Metro Vancouver the main area of rain will arrive later this evening as the front moves southward. \n\nThe continuous rain will end overnight or early Friday morning as the front pushes to the east. In the wake of the front, there will be showers with a risk of thunderstorms and gusty winds through Friday. \n\nStay tuned to Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest forecasts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-08-02T08:33:19-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-08-02T00:34:19-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0780087678.2019<br>Area: West Vancouver Island, Inland Vancouver Island, Sunshine Coast - Gibsons to Earls Cove, Whistler, Howe Sound, North Shore - including West Vancouver and North Vancouver, Metro Vancouver - northeast including Coquitlam and Maple Ridge",
