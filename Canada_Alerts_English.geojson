				"Summary" : "Description: Strong winds that may cause damage are expected or occurring.\n\nA potent winter storm is set to impact Baffin Island later today and through to Monday.\n\nThis weather system will bring the potential for wind gusts in excess of 90 km/h to Pangnirtung beginning early Sunday morning and persisting through the day. Winds will gradually diminish Sunday evening. Some snow is forecast with this system as well, which combined with the strong winds will create reduced visibilities in blowing snow. \n\nConfidence is relatively high that these significant wind gusts will materialize, but there is still some uncertainty in regards to the track of the system, so this warning may be adjusted as the system approaches. Please stay alert for updated bulletins.\n\n###\n\nDamage to buildings, such as to roof shingles and windows, may occur. Loose objects may be tossed by the wind and cause injury or damage.\n\nWind warnings are issued when there is a significant risk of damaging winds.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
