				"Summary" : "Description: A significant winter storm is expected today and tonight.\n\nThis Winter Storm Warning replaces the Snowfall Warning that was previously in effect.\n\nSnow, at times heavy, will continue today and gradually taper to flurries Thursday afternoon.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts of 25 to 35 cm are expected by Thursday afternoon. The stretch of highway 11 from Hearst northwest to Calstock may experience higher snowfall rates than areas further southeast, that may significantly impact travel.\n\nIn the southeastern sections, from Moonbeam to Smooth Rock Falls, snow may mix with rain beginning this afternoon as temperatures rise above the freezing mark. The snow mixed with rain will then transition to snow early Thursday morning and taper to flurries Thursday afternoon. \n\nBrisk northerly winds gusting up to 50 km/h are expected from this evening into Thursday and will result in localized blowing snow over exposed areas.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

As the low pressure system lifts northward Thursday, the rain is forecast to transition over to snow. The snow may become mixed with ice pellets or freezing rain for a period Thursday or Thursday night. By Friday, Christmas Day, the snow may become heavy at times, resulting in hazardous travel conditions. Local blowing snow is also possible.\n\nSnowfall accumulations in the 5 to 20 cm range will be possible, with the majority of the snow falling early Friday morning, which is Christmas morning.\n\nSnowfall Warnings may be required.\n\nThere remains considerable uncertainty as to the exact track of the low pressure system responsible for the rain and snow.

				"Summary" : "Description: Potentially heavy rain followed by significant snow early Friday.\n\nRain is forecast to begin tonight ahead of an approaching low pressure system. This rain will then continue into Thursday and become heavy at times. Total rainfall amounts of 15 to 25 mm are likely.  \n\nBy Thursday evening or Thursday night, the rain is expected to change over to snow after the passage of a strong cold front. Several centimetres of snowfall accumulation will be possible Thursday night through Friday morning, which is Christmas morning. Locally significant accumulations may cause hazardous driving conditions into Saturday morning.\n\nThere remains considerable uncertainty as to the exact track of this low pressure system and the timing of the changeover from rain to snow. This will ultimately affect how much snow may fall at any particular location.\n\nMotorists should be prepared for deteriorating winter driving conditions in areas that receive snow from Thursday evening through Friday morning.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Locally higher amounts up to 25 cm are possible for areas closer to Kapuskasing and Hornepayne. \n\nBrisk northerly winds gusting 50 to 60 km/h are expected from this evening into Thursday and will result in localized blowing snow over exposed areas.\n\nAreas south of Missinaibi lake, which include the city of Chapleau and Sultan, will not receive as much snow. These areas may receive a few centimeters of snow this morning followed by rain showers this afternoon. Early Thursday morning, the rain showers will transition to snow and taper to flurries Thursday afternoon. A total snowfall amount of up to 5 cm is possible for these areas on Thursday.\n\nConsider post-poning non essential travel in the northern areas until conditions improve. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
