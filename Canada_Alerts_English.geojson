This precipitation may start as freezing rain for a few hours before switching to rain as temperatures warm. Some ice accretion is possible, and untreated roads and surfaces may become slippery. With the warm up into the evening, any ice accretion from the morning should melt.\n\nA Freezing Rain Warning is being considered as this event draws nearer. Note, Environment Canada's criteria for a Freezing Rain Warning is freezing rain lasting 2 or more hours or causing impact.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Significant snowfall expected beginning Saturday evening.\n\nTotal snowfall: 15 to 20 cm.\n\nMaximum wind gusts: 40 to 60 km/h.\n\nLocations: central and northern New Brunswick.\n\nTime span: Saturday evening through Sunday night.\n\nRemarks: Heavy snow is expected to spread across parts of New Brunswick on Saturday evening, with strong winds and local blowing snow possible. The snow will likely change briefly to freezing rain or ice pellets over south-central parts of the province on Saturday night. Coastal regions along the Fundy shore should remain warm enough for rain with this system. There still remains some uncertainty with the track of this system at this time. The rain-snow line may shift slightly and warnings may be required as this system draws nearer.\n\nConditions will improve across the Maritimes on Monday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
