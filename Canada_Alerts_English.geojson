There is also the risk of freezing rain or ice pellets.\n\nRain is forecast to develop over the region Thursday morning. This rain is then expected to continue through Thursday night. Total rainfall amounts of 25 to 40 mm are possible with this event. \n\nBy Friday morning, Christmas Day, the rain is expected to change to scattered flurries or periods of snow as temperatures drop to below the freezing mark. There may also be a period of freezing rain or ice pellets during the transition. A few centimetres of snow will be possible.\n\nThis rain is associated with a strong low pressure system that will approach the area from the south Thursday. There remains some uncertainty as to the exact track of this low pressure system. Areas may transition to snow earlier than currently forecast, changing associated precipitation amounts.\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is a possible as the frozen ground has a reduced ability to absorb rainfall. \n\nRainfall Warnings may be required as the event draws closer. Some regions may require freezing rain warnings during the storm.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
