Strong northerly winds and blowing snow can be expected in the Hopedale area on Saturday but these winds won't reach the Postville - Makkovik area until Saturday evening.

Under snow squall bands visibility can be reduced due to heavy snow and blowing snow, and snow can quickly accumulate.\n\nTotal snowfall: locally 5 to possibly 15 cm in the most intense squalls.\n\nMaximum wind gusts: 50-60 km/h.\n\nLocations: West coast of Cape Breton and over the Highlands.\n\nTimespan: This afternoon into this evening, and Saturday afternoon into the evening.\n\nRemarks: Areas along the west coast and over the Highlands are at highest threat, with the intensity likely to be highest today. Early on Saturday, the winds and snow will diminish but will again increase Saturday afternoon into the evening. Total snowfall amounts may reach 20 cm.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Persistent snow squalls are expected to develop. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nPossible snowfall amounts: locally  15 cm or more.\n\nLocation: Hawkes Bay to Trout River.\n\nTime span: tonight and Saturday.\n\nRemarks: Onshore flurries will persist today through Saturday.  The highest snowfall accumulations today will be over higher elevations with much lower amounts along the coast.  Conditions will become more favourable for snow squall development tonight through Saturday with potential for significant accumulations and poor visibilities over any areas under the snow squalls.  \n\nAdditionally, strong westerly winds gusting to 50 or 60 km/h tonight and Saturday will cause blowing snow over exposed areas, especially during the snow squalls.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
