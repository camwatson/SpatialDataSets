				"Summary" : "Description: Rainfall, combined with melting snow, is expected. The frozen ground has a reduced ability to absorb this rainfall.\n\nShowers will intensify this afternoon into tonight with rainfall amounts of 15 to 25 mm expected by early Monday morning. The potential for higher amounts exists, especially over higher elevations where accumulations could reach and potentially exceed 50 mm. \n\nFurthermore, the rain will combine with mild temperatures to cause significant snowmelt and an increased potential for localized flooding.\n\nShowers are expected to taper off by noon on Monday.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
