				"Summary" : "Description: Winter Weather Travel Advisory in effect for Monday afternoon into Tuesday morning.\n\nSnow will begin Monday afternoon and continue into early Tuesday morning. Total snowfall amounts near 10 cm are possible.\n\nTravel will be impacted due to accumulating snow, particularly during the Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning commutes.\n\nThis snowfall is due to a developing low pressure system which will track south of the lower Great Lakes on Monday. There remains some uncertainty regarding the track of the low, and the expected snowfall amounts. \n\nEnvironment Canada will continue to monitor the situation.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Arctic air entrenched in the central interior combined with a Pacific warm front delivering warm moist air aloft will produce a wintry mix on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nFreezing rain or ice pellets will develop over the Prince George, Cariboo, Chilcotin and 100 Mile regions Monday evening and last through to Tuesday morning.\n\nFreezing rain and ice pellets are forecast to change to rain or showers on Tuesday as the warm air reaches the surface and brings the temperature above zero.\n\nOver the Bulkley Valley region including Smithers, snow or ice pellets will develop near midday Monday. The potential for freezing rain will depend on the position of the warm front and the strength of the warm air aloft.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A snowfall to start the week.\n\nA low pressure system over the Northeastern United States will bring snow over Southern Quebec late in the afternoon on Monday. The snow will intensify in the evening and persist during the day Tuesday, reaching Eastern Quebec. The morning commute will be particularly difficult Tuesday morning. Snowfall amounts of approximately 15 centimetres are expected over Southern and Central Quebec but could exceed 15 centimetres in the Eastern Townships, Beauce and Eastern Quebec. The snow will be accompanied by strong winds over Central and Eastern Quebec and give reduced visibilities in blowing snow.\n\nAccumulating snow will make travel difficult.\n\nBe prepared for hazardous driving conditions because of reduced visibilities.\n\nThe public is advised to monitor future forecasts for more information as the low pressure system's track becomes more certain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A snowfall to start the week.\n\nA low pressure system over the Northeastern United States will bring a heavy snowfall to start the week. Snow will reach Eastern Quebec Monday evening and intensify during the day on Tuesday. Precipitation will continue through Wednesday. Snowfall amounts of 20 to 30 centimetres are expected over the Lower St Lawrence, Gasp√© Peninsula and North Shore areas. The snow will be accompanied by strong winds and will give reduced visibilities in blowing snow.\n\nAccumulating snow will make travel difficult.\n\nHazardous driving conditions can be expected due to reduced visibilities.\n\nPlease monitor future forecasts for more information as the low pressure system's track becomes more certain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
