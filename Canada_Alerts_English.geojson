				"Summary" : "Description: Possible high levels of air pollution due to smoke from forest fires are expected tonight and Tuesday. \n\nSmoke plumes are moving over Pikangikum from three separate forest fires located southwest of the community. Forecast winds are expected to remain light out of the west or southwest tonight. These smoke plumes may affect the region for a few days. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-02T21:49:21-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-02T05:50:21-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2790175384.2019<br>Area: Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell",

Maximum daytime temperatures of 31 degrees are possible with overnight minimum temperatures likely remaining near 21 degrees providing little relief from the heat. \n\nScattered showers or thunderstorms expected Tuesday onward could prevent maximum daytime highs from reaching 31 degrees. However, maximum humidex values are still expected to be near 40. The hot and humid conditions are expected to remain in the area until the weekend.\n\nA cold front is expected to move through on Saturday and bring cooler conditions to the area.\n\n###\n\nExtreme heat affects everyone.\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
