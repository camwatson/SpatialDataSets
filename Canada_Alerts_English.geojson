				"Summary" : "Description: A shift from the mild, above seasonal weather is coming to southern Manitoba.\n\nA fast moving low pressure system will track across the northern United States spreading mixed precipitation to southern Manitoba on Wednesday night, beginning first over western areas on Wednesday evening and tracking eastwards through the night.  This low pressure system will bring a mix of rain, snow and freezing rain.  A narrow band of 5 to 10 cm of snowfall accumulation will stretch from roughly Brandon to Winnipeg to the Ontario border although there is some uncertainty in the exact location of this narrow band of precipitation.  There is also a significant risk for freezing rain, over western Manitoba and especially over the Red River Valley and points eastwards during the late evening and overnight hours. \n\nFreezing rain warnings may be required as the event nears and conditions are monitored.\n\nThis low pressure system will usher in a cooler, more seasonal weather pattern.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A shift from the mild, above seasonal weather is coming to southern Saskatchewan.\n\nA fast moving low pressure system will track across the northern United States spreading mixed precipitation to southern Saskatchewan on Wednesday, beginning first over western areas on Wednesday morning and tracking eastwards through the day.  This low pressure system will bring a mix of rain, snow and freezing rain.  A narrow band of 2 to 5 cm of snowfall accumulation will stretch from roughly Leader to Regina although there is some uncertainty in the exact location of this narrow band of precipitation.  The highest likelihood for freezing rain is over south central areas during the morning hours through mid day Wednesday.\n\nFreezing rain warnings may be required as the event nears and conditions are monitored.\n\nThis low pressure system will usher in a cooler, more seasonal weather pattern.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

This low pressure system will bring a mix of rain, snow and freezing rain.  A narrow band of 5 to 10 cm of snowfall accumulation will stretch from roughly Brandon to Winnipeg to the Ontario border although there is some uncertainty in the exact location of this narrow band of precipitation.  There is also a significant risk for freezing rain, over western Manitoba and especially over the Red River Valley and points eastwards during the late evening and overnight hours. \n\nFreezing rain warnings may be required as the event nears and conditions are monitored.\n\nThis low pressure system will usher in a cooler, more seasonal weather pattern.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
