				"Summary" : "Description: Areas of brief, intense snowfall are expected early this morning from frontal snow squalls. \n\nA cold front moving over the area from Georgian Bay will continue to result in sudden low visibilities and a quick accumulation of snow early this morning. Total snowfall amounts near 10 cm are possible, especially in the Parry Sound area and inland towards Bracebridge.\n\nAfter the cold front winds will become northwesterly and isolated lake effect snow squalls will develop to the southeast of Georgian Bay. Some of the snow squalls may give snowfall accumulations near 15 centimetres by Wednesday evening.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nSnow squall warnings are issued when bands of snow form that produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Areas of brief, intense snowfall are expected early this morning from frontal snow squalls. \n\nA cold front is moving over the area and will result in low visibilities and a quick accumulation of snow. While snowfall accumulation should remain limited to 2 to 4 cm, heavy snow combined with blowing snow may result in hazardous travel.\n\nLake effect snow squalls from Lake Huron are then expected to develop this morning. Some of the snow squalls may give snowfall accumulations in excess of 15 centimetres by Wednesday evening along with extensive blowing snow, particularly near Lake Huron.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
