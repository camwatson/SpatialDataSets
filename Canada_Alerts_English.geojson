				"Summary" : "Description: Periods of brief but intense snowfall are expected. Visibilities will be rapidly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow.\n\nA cold front tracking quickly eastward across the northern grainbelt will bring a brief period of heavy snowfall along with strong northwesterly winds as it moves across the region. The heavy snowfall will last for approximately one hour at one particular location but the northwest winds, gusting up to 80 km/h, will likely persist into the late afternoon or early evening.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
