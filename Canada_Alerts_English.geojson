				"Summary" : "Description: DUST ADVISORY ISSUED FOR VERNON\n\nApril 2, 2019 - Vernon.  The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, in collaboration with the Interior Health Authority, has issued a Dust Advisory for Vernon due to high concentrations of coarse particulates which are expected to persist until there is a change in current weather conditions.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Staying indoors and in air-conditioned spaces helps to reduce particulate exposure. Exposure is particularly a concern for infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-04-03T12:48:31-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

These winds will reach 40 to 60 knots and will usher in colder air, will produce wave heights of 3 to 6 metres along with freezing spray. Marine conditions will be particularly hazardous for the small crafts in this early fishing season.

It will give 10 to 15 centimetres of snow over the north shore of the Gaspé Peninsula between Wednesday afternoon and the following night. Then, high westerly winds will develop late in the night in the wake of the storm, causing blowing snow significantly reducing visibilities locally and bringing a rapid drop in temperatures. These poor conditions will continue through Thursday, making for hazardous driving conditions due to poor visibility and potentially icy and slippery roads.\n\n###\n\nBlowing snow advisories are issued when winds are expected to create blowing snow giving poor visibility to 800 metres or less for at least 3 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
