				"Summary" : "Description: A mixed bag of precipitation from Saturday evening through Sunday.\n\nA low pressure system from the American Midwest will affect Southwestern Quebec beginning Saturday evening. Precipitation will then gradually spread toward Eastern Quebec. Although precipitation is expected to begin as snow, it is highly possible that it changes to freezing rain over areas near the St Lawrence River and even rain over areas further south. Total snowfall amounts will vary depending on how the system evolves, but they could exceed 15 centimetres over areas north of the St Lawrence River. Additionally, expected rainfall amounts should reach between 10 and 15 millimetres, at this time.\n\nTravel could be difficult.\n\nAt this time, computer model guidance still shows significant variability regarding the system's track. Consequently, there is much uncertainty and the scenario could still change significantly.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A mixed bag of precipitation from Saturday evening through Sunday.\n\nA low pressure system from the American Midwest will affect Southwestern Quebec beginning Saturday evening. Precipitation will then gradually spread toward Eastern Quebec.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts will vary depending on how the system develops, but they could exceed 15 centimetres over areas north of the St Lawrence River.\n\nCentral Quebec and the areas near the St Lawrence River could also see freezing rain overnight Saturday night.\n\nAdditionally, rain is expected over the Monteregie and the Eastern Townships areas. Expected rainfall amounts should reach between 10 and 15 millimetres.\n\nTravel could be difficult.\n\nAt this time, model guidance still suggests significant variability regarding the system's track. Therefore, some uncertainty remains and this scenario could still change significantly.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
