Some improvement is expected early Wednesday before a cold front with northerly gusts to 70 km/h sweeps across the north basin of the lake Wednesday afternoon, bringing a fresh round of blowing snow.  Conditions should improve everywhere by Thursday morning.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlowing snow advisories are issued when winds are expected to create blowing snow giving poor visibility to 800 metres or less for at least 3 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Under these snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to heavy snow. These bands will shift with time over the region, thus limiting amounts in a given location. However, snowfall accumulations of up to 15 cm are expected in a few locales by Wednesday midday when the snow squalls taper to flurries.\n\nIn addition, strong westerly winds gusting to 50 km/h will result in local blowing snow and may cause near-zero visibility at times.\n\nMotorists are advised to exercise caution or consider postponing travel.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
