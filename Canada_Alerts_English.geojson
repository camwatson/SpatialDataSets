				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing damaging wind gusts, damaging hail and torrential rain.\n\nThunderstorms have developed and are moving slowly toward the east. Severe thunderstorms will persist through this evening.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Severe thunderstorms will persist through this evening.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

These severe thunderstorms have produced nickel to golfball sized hail and locally heavy downpours. These thunderstorms will persist into the evening and continue to track eastward. Strong gusty winds and large hail are likely this evening.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.<br>Expires: 2019-06-30T02:22:14-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-06-30T00:04:14-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3278343110.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Grahamdale incl.

These severe thunderstorms have produced nickel to golfball sized hail and locally heavy downpours. These thunderstorms will persist into the evening and continue to track eastward. Strong gusty winds and large hail are likely this evening.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.<br>Expires: 2019-06-30T03:22:33-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-06-30T00:24:33-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2714650607.2019<br>Area: Waterhen Meadow Portage and Skownan, R.M. of Grahamdale incl.
