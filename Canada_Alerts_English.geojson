				"Summary" : "Description: The first significant snowfall of the season will continue tonight and persist through Monday for the Foothills and much of Southern Alberta.\n\nSnow falling along the foothills and over southern Alberta will continue to spread northward overnight and into Sunday. The highest accumulations are expected to remain along the foothills, Mountain Parks and near the international border. Snowfall accumulations to the north and west of Calgary could see near 10 to 15 cm of snow before the system moves out of the province on Monday.\n\nPoor driving conditions throughout the weekend can be expected in southwestern Alberta, including portions of Highway 1 and the QEII.\n\nHeavy wet snow may cause tree branches to break. \n\nWet snow may also cause power outages. \n\nThis is expected to be a long duration event, with snow tapering off by Monday afternoon. Temperatures are forecast to rebound into the low-mid teens by mid-week, making this brief brush with winter just that...brief.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nAn intense low pressure system over the northwestern United States will slowly work its way northeastward and spread snow over southwestern Saskatchewan. The snow has begun in the southwest corner of the province this morning and will work its way northeast, reaching Moose Jaw and Regina some time tonight. By the time it gets to Regina, precipitation will be mainly in the form of rain.\n\nThe worst conditions will be south of Swift Current and west of Assiniboia overnight and throughout the day on Sunday where snow and blowing snow will give significantly reduced visibilities. The snow will continue pushing northeast towards the Outlook and Humboldt regions Sunday night.\n\nA winter storm watch is also in effect for the Leader, Swift Current, and Moose Jaw regions as the worst conditions will arrive there a bit later.\n\nTotal snowfalls could reach 30 cm near the Cypress Hills, with amounts gradually lessening as you go north and east. Areas south and east of Regina will have either rain or mixed precipitation, while areas north of Saskatoon will escape the brunt of the system.\n\nPlease listen for updated watches and warnings as this system moves in over the next day or so.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nAn intense low pressure system over the northwestern United States is slowly working its way northeastward spreading snow over southwestern Saskatchewan. As of mid-afternoon the snow has spread into the southwest corner of the province and will work its way northeast, reaching Moose Jaw and Regina some time tonight. By the time it gets to Regina, precipitation will be mainly in the form of rain...at least until Sunday evening, when wet snowfall accumulation is likely in the city.\n\nThe worst conditions will be south of Swift Current and west of Assiniboia overnight and throughout the day on Sunday where snow and blowing snow will give significantly reduced visibilities. The snow will continue pushing northeast towards the Outlook and Humboldt regions Sunday night.\n\nTotal snowfalls could exceed 30 cm near the Cypress Hills, with amounts gradually lessening as you go north and east. Areas south and east of Regina will have either rain or mixed precipitation, while areas north of Saskatoon will escape the brunt of the system.  Saskatoon itself will likely see some snowfall accumulations Sunday evening.\n\nPlease listen for updated watches and warnings as this system develops.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: An intense low pressure system over the northwestern United States will slowly work its way northeastward and spread snow over southwestern Saskatchewan. The snow has begun in the southwest corner of the province this morning and will work its way northeast, reaching Moose Jaw and Regina some time tonight. By the time it gets to Regina, precipitation will be mainly in the form of rain.\n\nThe worst conditions will be south of Swift Current and west of Assiniboia overnight and throughout the day on Sunday where snow and blowing snow will give significantly reduced visibilities. The snow will continue pushing northeast towards the Outlook and Humboldt regions Sunday night with the snow there continuing into Monday. \n\nA winter storm warning is in effect for the Shaunavon and Assiniboia regions where this event will begin today. This watch may also be upgraded to a warning later today as the system pushes into the area. \nTotal snowfalls of 15 to 25 cm are possible, with up to 30 cm near the Cypress Hills. Areas south and east of Regina will have either rain or mixed precipitation, while areas north of Saskatoon will escape the brunt of the system. \n\nPlease listen for updated watches and warnings as they may be expanded to neighbouring regions as the system moves in.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
