				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing damaging wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nAs a cold front continues to traverse Saskatchewan this evening, thunderstorms continue to develop along the front. For much of southern and central Saskatchewan, some of the thunderstorms that develop have the potential to become severe.\n\nThe cold front is tracking rapidly across Saskatchewan, so the weather may change quickly. Stay alert for updated bulletins as the watch area may be extended early this evening.\n\nAlso of note, this cold front will bring a change in weather conditions as it pulls down cooler air from the arctic. Expect gusty northwesterly winds and cooler temperatures behind the cold front. Cooler temperatures will persist for the next few days.\n\n###\n\nVery strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to SKstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #SKStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-07-02T07:59:36-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-02T00:23:36-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3749288755.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Lacadena including Kyle Tyner and Sanctuary, R.M. of Victory including Beechy, R.M. of Canaan including Lucky Lake, R.M. of Riverside including Cabri Pennant and Success, R.M. of Saskatchewan Landing including Stewart Valley, R.M. of Webb including Webb and Antelope lake, R.M. of Swift Current including Swift Current and Wymark, R.M. of Lac Pelletier including Blumenhof, R.M. of Excelsior including Waldeck Rush Lake and Main Centre, R.M. of Morse including Herbert Morse Ernfold and Gouldtown, R.M. of Coulee including Neidpath and McMahon, R.M. of Lawtonia including Hodgeville, R.M. of Glen Bain including Glen Bain, R.M. of Whiska Creek including Vanguard Neville and Pambrun, R.M. of Maple Creek including Maple Creek, R.M. of Maple Creek including Cypress Hills Prov.
