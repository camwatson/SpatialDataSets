The Paddle River downstream from the Paddle River Dam remains high and waters continue to exceed the dyke system along the confluence. The Paddle River Reservoir has reached capacity due to snow melt into the head waters. Ice on the Pembina River is now breaking up and moving downstream.\n###\nResidents and the travelling public will continue to encounter high water levels in roadside ditches, and water encroaching or crossing on many area roadways, including highways as waters move through the system.  Agricultural lands along the Paddle system will see additional overland flooding as melt waters continue to flow over the dykes.<br>Expires: 2020-04-28T10:14:11-06:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Lac Ste.
