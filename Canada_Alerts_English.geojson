				"Summary" : "Description: Strong to severe winds Wednesday and Thursday along with a mix of wintery precipitation and blowing snow.\n\nA clipper system will cross Saskatchewan Wednesday resulting in widespread strong winds of 60 gusting 80 km/h across the southern half of the province. The strong winds will begin in the southwest Wednesday morning, expand eastward through the day, and generally continue into Thursday. Localized severe gusts to 100 km/h are possible - most likely Wednesday afternoon or evening - though exact timing and location remain unclear as the track of this system continues to evolve. \n\nIn addition, a mix of scattered rain showers, potential freezing rain, and finally some snow will accompany the system. Amounts are generally expected to be low, but isolated snow squalls and banding could see local totals of 5 to 10 cm. With the strong winds ongoing across the south, visibilities will be reduced at times due to snow and blowing snow. The winds and lingering snow will both taper off late Thursday as the system finally departs the prairies.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Periods of snow on Wednesday with another 5 to 10 cm. \n\nA strong warm front will bring a lot of moisture and increasing snow level to southern BC today and tonight. The trailing cold front will move across the region from the northwest to southeast on Wednesday, lowering the snow level and producing more snow over the highway passes. \n\nAs the snow level can change significantly between different locations, the exact timing and snowfall amounts will vary.

				"Summary" : "Description: High concentration of pollutants are expected and will result in poor air quality, especially in urban areas where pollutant emissions are higher.\n\nHigh levels of pollutants are expected to persist until Wednesday morning.\n\n###\n\nSmog especially affects asthmatic children and people with respiratory ailments or heart disease. It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health. You can also visit the Direction régionale de santé publique du CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l’Île-de-Montréal at www.santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-01-13T19:04:16-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux, the Direction régionale de santé publique du CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l’Île-de-Montréal, the City of Montréal, 2021-01-12T20:49:16-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0662721842.2021<br>Area: Louiseville area, Matawin - Mauricie National Park area, Lac-aux-Sables area, Shawinigan area, Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade area, Trois-Rivières area",
