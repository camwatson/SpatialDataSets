				"Summary" : "Description: A period of very cold wind chills is expected.\n\nAn Arctic high exiting the Prairies will bring another cold morning to the region with extreme wind chill values.\n\nTemperatures near -30C combined with winds of 10 to 20 km/h will produce wind chills of -40 to -45 this morning.\n\nThese extreme wind chills will moderate late this morning. Much warmer weather will spread across the Prairies through the second half of the week.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nWatch for cold related symptoms: shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle pain and weakness, numbness and colour change in fingers and toes.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted.  Exposure is particularly a concern for infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease. \n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-02-20T00:15:48-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
