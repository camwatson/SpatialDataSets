The snow may start to mix with rain overnight or on Sunday after which time further accumulations will be limited. Total snowfall accumulations at Naujaat this weekend will likely end up in the 20 to 30 cm range. In addition to the snow, strong southeast winds will gust to 60 or 70 km/h, creating blowing snow at times.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
