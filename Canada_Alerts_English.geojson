				"Summary" : "Description: Winter Weather Travel Advisory in effect for today and tonight.\n\nHeavy bursts of snow associated with the passage of a low pressure system could affect road conditions and visibilities this morning.\n\nIn the early afternoon cold westerly and northwesterly winds will generate lake effect snow squalls that could persist until midnight. These snow squall bands will continuously shift over the region which will limit the snowfall amount over a given location. A total snowfall accumulation of 5 to 10 cm is expected by Wednesday morning. Locally higher snowfall amounts are also possible.\n\nUnder the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to heavy snow and blowing snow. Difficult winter travel conditions are expected.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Under these snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow. Total snowfall accumulations of 15 to 20 cm are possible in some locales by Wednesday midday when the snow squalls taper to flurries.\n\nIn addition, strong westerly winds gusting to 50 km/h will result in local blowing snow and may cause near-zero visibility at times.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
