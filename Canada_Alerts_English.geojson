Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre has issued a Flood Watch for northern Manitoba and southeast Manitoba including the Whiteshell Lakes due to expected high flows from recent and expected precipitation. Overland flooding is also possible.\n\nIf you are in the affected area, be watchful of local waterways as rivers and lake levels are expected to rise and may cause flooding. Do not attempt to cross fast flowing waters or waters of unknown depth. Use caution when driving on all roads as road conditions may have changed. Avoid flooded areas. Follow all directions by local authorities, and listen for updates and take all necessary precautions to stay safe.\n\nUp to date information is available at www.gov.mb.ca/flooding and www.manitoba511.ca Follow @MBGov and @MBGovRoads on Twitter or stay tuned to local media.<br>Expires: 2020-06-22T12:00:00-05:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Manitoba Emergency Measures Organization, 2020-06-17T15:01:09-05:00, 99900710-D6D1-BA15-02A3-71950EE909C1<br>Area: Northern Manitoba and Southeast Manitoba including the Whiteshell Lakes",
