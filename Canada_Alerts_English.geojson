Regina and Estevan should see improvement this evening and Carlyle overnight. Snowfall amounts over southeastern Saskatchewan will range from 1 to 5 cm, however considerably higher amounts are possible west of Estevan and south of the international border.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A strong low pressure system which has been giving heavy snow and blizzard conditions to parts of southern Alberta and Saskatchewan will also affect southern Manitoba but to a much lesser degree. \n\nThe worst conditions will remain south of the international border as the low tracks into the Dakotas. A mixture of light rain and snow will spread over much of southern Manitoba tonight, however snowfall will be relatively light in most areas. \n\nAn exception to this will be over the Melita and Killarney regions where there will likely be enough snow tonight to turn the ground white, especially over the higher terrain of the Turtle Mountains where significant accumulations of 10 or more cm are possible. \n\nThe precipitation will taper off Monday morning as the system weakens and moves off to the east.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Blizzard conditions with poor visibility in snow and blowing snow are expected or occurring.\n\nA low pressure system which tracked through southern Saskatchewan brought heavy snow and blowing snow to southwestern regions today.\n\nStrong northerly winds gusted at times to 80 km/h combined with the falling snow gave blizzard conditions in many areas near and south of the Trans-Canada highway and to the west of the Wascana Basin. Blizzard conditions are expected to improve early this evening around Swift Current and Maple Creek, and later this evening towards Val Marie and Mankota as the snow and wind both diminish. \n\nSnowfall totals with this system will range from 10 to 20 cm in many areas, with local amounts over 30 cm in the Cypress Hills.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
