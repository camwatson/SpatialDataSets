Below seasonal temperatures to continue through the weekend.\n\nA low pressure system will pass just off Vancouver Island Friday morning and move onto the Washington coast Friday evening. Meanwhile, modified Arctic air will advance southward through the B.C. interior. By Friday afternoon, the Arctic front is expected to reach Kamloops and pile up against the east side of the Rockies.\n\nWith a somewhat cool airmass already in place, widespread snow is expected from the Chilcotin and 100 MIle area to the Fraser Canyon and eastward to the Kootenays and parts of the Columbias. Snow may become mixed with rain over southern and eastern portions of this area. Currently, forecast snowfall amounts range from 5 to 15 cm.\n\nIn the wake of the low, a drying trend begins on Saturday as the Arctic air spreads through the rest of the southern interior. Temperatures of 10 degrees below seasonal normals are expected through the weekend.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nA cold airmass combined with winds off the waters of Lake Winnipeg will create a favourable setup for snowsqualls.  \n\nWesterly winds this evening will initially place most of the snowsqualls in the Poplar River area. However, overnight the winds are expected to shift to the northwest repositioning the snowsqualls towards the Berens River area. The snowsqualls are expected to remain in this area on Friday.  \n\nSnow amounts will be highly localized but may exceed 20 to 30 cm in some areas by the time the snow squalls diminish on Saturday night as the wind shifts to a more northerly direction.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.

				"Summary" : "Description: More early season snowfall expected on Friday as Arctic air arrives. Below seasonal temperatures to continue through the weekend.\n\nA low pressure system will pass just off Vancouver Island Friday morning and move onto the Washington coast Friday evening. Meanwhile, modified Arctic air will advance southward through the B.C. interior. By Friday afternoon, the Arctic front is expected to reach Kamloops and pile up against the east side of the Rockies.\n\nWith a somewhat cool airmass already in place, widespread snow is expected from Bella Coola and Whistler eastward to 100 Mile and the southwest interior, and further to the Kootenays and parts of the Columbias. Snow may become mixed with rain over southern and eastern portions of this area. Currently, forecast snowfall amounts range from 5 to 15 cm.\n\nIn the wake of the low, a drying trend begins on Saturday as the Arctic air spreads through the rest of the southern interior. Temperatures of 10 degrees below seasonal normals are expected through the weekend.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
