				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nTotal snowfall: 20 to 35 cm, with the highest accumulations expected over the Connaigre and Burin peninsulas and in the Clarenville and Terra Nova areas.\n\nMaximum wind gusts: northeasterly 80 to 100 km/h becoming northwesterly 80 to 100 km/h.\n\nLocations: southern and eastern Newfoundland.\n\nTime span: today into Tuesday.\n\nRemarks: Snow has begun for southernmost regions, and will intensify and push north this morning. The snow combined with strong northeasterly winds this morning and strong northwesterly winds this afternoon and evening will cause reduced visibilities in blowing snow. \n\nOver the Avalon, the snow will become mixed with ice pellets later this morning and is expected to change to rain or drizzle over some areas this afternoon.\n\nConditions will improve overnight tonight for areas along the south coast as the snow tapers to flurries; however, strong northwesterly winds will persist into Tuesday afternoon which will may cause reduced visibility in blowing snow over some areas. Strong northwesterly winds and periods of snow will persist over more northern areas, including the St. John's Metro area, throughout the night and into Tuesday morning before tapering to onshore flurries.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A period of severely cold wind chills is expected.\n\nExtreme cold will persist for a few days.\n\nAn Arctic ridge of high pressure has allowed for a very cold air mass to settle over southern Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba.\n\nAlong with winds of 10 to 20 km/h, extreme wind chill values between -40 and -50 are expected over most of southern Manitoba and Saskatchewan once again today.\n\nThe bitterly cold air will remain over the Prairies for much of the next week.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nFor more information on cold and your health, visit Manitoba Health at https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/cold.html or call Health Links - Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
