Many areas rebound only slightly from these bitterly cold values during the day on Friday before another round of more expansive cold sets in across the province Friday night.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Total snowfall amounts of 20 to 30 cm are likely by the time the snow comes to an end.\n\nTravel conditions along Highway 17 between Nipigon and Wawa will likely become hazardous due to accumulating snow and very low visibility. Motorists should consider changing travel plans accordingly. \n\nThe town of Wawa is expected to receive lesser amounts than areas farther west along the shore of Lake Superior.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Rapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult.

				"Summary" : "Description: A period of very cold wind chills is expected.\n\nA ridge of arctic high pressure will keep skies relatively clear and allow for a very cold air mass to move into portions of northern Manitoba from Nunavut tonight. \n\nAlong with winds of 10 to 15 km/h, extreme cold wind chills of -45 or colder are expected over the next few days as the stagnant area of high pressure remains parked over the province. \n\nExtreme cold warnings will likely be expanded to include most of the province come Friday night.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nFor more information on cold and your health, visit Manitoba Health at https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/cold.html or call Health Links - Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
