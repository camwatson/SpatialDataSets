				"Summary" : "Description: Due to the widespread power outages caused by last night’s storm, SaskTel is experiencing some service outages in a number of communities across the province. Some communities have limited services at this time, and we anticipate more services may fail as back-up battery power depletes if commercial power is not restored. There is no estimated time of return for these services and it is likely that these services may not be restored until the power has been fully restored in these areas. Communities impacted include: Beechy, Herschel, Plenty, Dodsland, Saskatoon East, Lucky Lake, Warman, Meacham, Danielson (Diefenbaker Lake), Moose Jaw, Weyburn, Estevan.<br>Expires: 2021-01-15T09:00:00-06:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: SK SaskTel, 2021-01-14T09:46:22-06:00, 053C2BDB-1EAF-D133-A997-E59776771B34<br>Area: Saskatchewan",
