				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of very dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing damaging wind gusts, damaging hail and flooding rain.\n\nThunderstorms continue to develop over North Dakota and southern Manitoba this evening ahead of a trough of low pressure now located over western Manitoba. These storms will develop into a squall line and track eastward across southern Manitoba this evening and into eastern Manitoba overnight. Heavy rainfall can be expected again with fairly widespread 50 to 100 mm of rain possible. Combined with the heavy rainfall this morning, significant flooding can be expected with the already over saturated ground. Large hail and wind gusts over 100 km/h along the squall line are also likely. Isolated tornadoes with any embedded supercells over the southern Red River Valley this evening cannot be ruled out.\n\n###\n\nVery strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Heavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-09-21T10:39:01-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-09-20T23:50:01-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1752414668.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Elton incl.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of very dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing damaging wind gusts, large hail and flooding rain.\n\nThunderstorm activity will continue through the night over northern North Dakota and Minnesota. Some of these thunderstorms may move into southeastern Manitoba during the overnight hours and have the potential to bring torrential rain, strong winds, and intense lightning.\n\n###\n\nVery strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Heavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
