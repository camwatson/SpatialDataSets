				"Summary" : "Description: A period of severely cold wind chills continues.\n\nExtreme cold will persist for a couple more days.\n\nAn Arctic ridge of high pressure has allowed for a very cold air mass to settle over southern Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba.\n\nLight winds and morning temperatures of -35 and colder, will once again bring extreme wind chill values between -40 and -50 across most of southern Manitoba and Saskatchewan this morning. Wind chills will moderate during the day today, but wind chills of minus 40 to minus 50 are expected to return tonight.\n\nThe bitterly cold air will remain over the Prairies through the weekend.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nFor more information on cold and your health, visit Manitoba Health at https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/cold.html or call Health Links - Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Significant amounts of snow are expected.\n\nPacific moisture associated with an approaching frontal system is colliding with the arctic front along Vancouver Island. Snow heavy at times will continue this morning and the ease this afternoon. Further snowfall accumulations of up to 15 cm are expected. In addition, strong easterly winds will give areas of poor visibility in snow and blowing snow.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Poor weather conditions may contribute to transportation delays.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
