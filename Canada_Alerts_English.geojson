Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-11T21:59:20-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-11T07:28:20-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0717053775.2019<br>Area: Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake, Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell, Red Lake - Woodland Caribou Park, Ear Falls - Perrault Falls - Western Lac Seul",
