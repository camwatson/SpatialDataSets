Precipitation will start as snow over most areas Monday evening then change to a prolonged period of ice pellets and/or freezing rain Monday night into Tuesday before gradually changing to rain from southwest to northeast across the province on Tuesday. Latest indications show a potential for between 4 to 12 hours of freezing precipitation possible for some parts of the province, with the greatest risk over areas furthest inland as well as the northern half of the province on Tuesday. Note that as this system is still in early stages of development, this situation may change and it will continue to be closely monitored as it approaches in the event warnings may be required.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A period of severely cold wind chills continues.\n\nAn Arctic ridge of high pressure has allowed for a very cold air mass to settle over southern Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba.\n\nExtreme cold values of -40 to -50 have returned again this morning, with light winds and temperatures near -35 and colder forecast across most of southern Manitoba and Saskatchewan. \n\nExtreme wind chill values will moderate slightly during the day, but wind chills of -40 to -50 will return again tonight into Monday morning.\n\nThese extreme cold warnings are expected to gradually end through the week as temperatures ever so slowly creep towards seasonal normals.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Where appropriate, maintain physical distancing. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce particulate matter exposure. \n\nReal-time  air  quality  observations  and  information  regarding  the  health  effects  of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-02-14T18:00:13-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
