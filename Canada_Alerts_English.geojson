Conditions are expected to improve late overnight or Sunday morning when a ridge of high pressure moves over the region.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The mild air will result in rain at almost all elevations. High runoff and rising river levels are likely through the weekend.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
