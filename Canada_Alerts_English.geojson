This combined with a run of spring tides may cause some coastal flooding and overwash on north facing shorelines of the island, especially in the east. The highest risk will be near the high tides Thursday night and Friday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Significant storm expected later this week.\n\nLocations: central and eastern Newfoundland.\n\nTotal snowfall: Generally 20 to 40 cm with 40 to 70 cm possible in the vicinity of Trinity or Conception Bay.\n\nMaximum wind gusts: 100 to 120 km/h inland.  Generally 120 to 130 km/h along the coast with locally higher gusts over exposed areas.\n\nStorm surge: higher than normal water levels along the east and northeast coasts due to 60 to 80 cm of storm surge combined with 7 to 10 m waves.  Flooding and damage to coastal infrastructure is possible, especially in communities exposed to the north.  Highest water levels are expected near high tide on Friday night and again on Saturday morning.\n\nTime span: Thursday night until near noon Saturday.\n\nRemarks: An intense storm will affect the island later this week. Anyone planning travel or other weather-sensitive activities is urged to monitor forecasts and to begin considering alternate plans. Visibility will likely be reduced to zero over some areas, with blizzard conditions possible.  There continues to be a chance that areas of the eastern Avalon Peninsula could see a brief change over to rain on Friday afternoon.\n\nThere remains some uncertainty regarding the exact track and lowest pressure of this storm.  Any variations in track and pressure will affect the above mentioned numbers.  Please use this information as a general guide to prepare as the numbers may change before Thursday night. \n\nConditions are expected to improve by early Saturday for some areas but strong winds, snow and blowing snow will persist over coastal areas until mid day.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
