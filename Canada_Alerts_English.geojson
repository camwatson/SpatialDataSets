				"Summary" : "Description: Elevated pollution levels are expected or occurring.\n\nDUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR GOLDEN\n\nThe Ministry of Environment & Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with the Interior Health Authority has issued a Dust Advisory for Golden because of high concentrations of coarse particulate matter that are expected to persist until there is precipitation, dust suppression or a change in traffic patterns.\n\nLevels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. \nThis advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nExposure is particularly a concern for individuals with chronic conditions such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, and diabetes; respiratory infections such as COVID-19, pregnant women, infants, and older adults. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Where appropriate, maintain physical distancing. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider.\n\nStaying indoors helps to reduce particulate matter exposure.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of\nair pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-landwater/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-03-16T16:48:07-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
