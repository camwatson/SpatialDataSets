				"Summary" : "Description: Lake effect snow squalls continuing into this evening.\n\nIsolated snow squalls continue late this afternoon. Some of these snow squalls may give snowfall accumulations near 5 centimetres by the time the squalls come to an end early tonight. Also, strong winds gusting up to 60 km/h will combine with the fresh snow to result in local blowing snow, particularly over open areas.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-01-09T07:59:35-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-01-08T20:27:35-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3471071065.2020<br>Area: Saugeen Shores - Kincardine - Southern Bruce County, Wingham - Blyth - Northern Huron County, Listowel - Milverton - Northern Perth County, Goderich - Bluewater - Southern Huron County, Stratford - Mitchell - Southern Perth County, Mount Forest - Arthur - Northern Wellington County, Guelph - Erin - Southern Wellington County, Kitchener - Cambridge - Region of Waterloo",

However isolated snow squalls are possible tonight and Thursday as colder air moves into the region. Total amounts could exceed 60 cm in areas of heaviest snow. \n\nIn addition, strong northerly winds will develop this afternoon which, given the fresh fluffy snow, will produce reduced visibility in blowing snow through tonight and Thursday morning.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult.
