				"Summary" : "Description: Elevated pollution levels are expected or occurring.\n\nStagnant weather conditions under a ridge of high pressure are causing pollutants to build up with time. The poor air quality is expected to improve by Monday morning.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-01-31T11:17:14-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2021-01-30T19:18:14-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1183536002.2021<br>Area: Leduc Co. near Warburg Thorsby and Pigeon Lake, Leduc Co. near Calmar and Devon, Brazeau Co. near Drayton Valley and Breton, Co. of Wetaskiwin near Pigeon Lake, Co. of Wetaskiwin near Alder Flats and Winfield, Ponoka Co. near Rimbey Bluffton and Hoadley, Ponoka Co. near Crestomere",
