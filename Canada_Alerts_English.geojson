The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Northern Health has issued an Air Quality Advisory for Prince George due to high concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). This advisory remains in effect until further notice.\n\nExposure to fine particulate matter is of particular concern for infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.  Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. If you are experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, follow the advice of your health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce exposure to fine particulate matter.\n\nThe City of Prince Georgeâ€™s Clean Air Bylaw prohibits all open burning, including back-yard burning, and land clearing burning.  During air quality advisories, this bylaw also prohibits recreational fires, use of wood-burning appliances (except for sole wood burning heat users), and street sweeping activties (unless approved by an Authorized Person). Industry is required to follow permit requirements that are triggered during airquality advisories and are asked to reduce emissions wherever possible. Real-time airquality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at www.bcairquality.ca.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-12-02T11:46:38-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

Staying indoors helps to reduce fine particulate exposure. Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women and infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease. If you are experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, follow the advice of your health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce exposure to fine particulate matter. \n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-12-02T11:42:29-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

Ice build-up may cause tree branches to break.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
