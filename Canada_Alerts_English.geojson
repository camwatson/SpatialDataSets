				"Summary" : "Description: More early season snowfall expected on Friday as Arctic air arrives. Below seasonal temperatures to continue through the weekend.\n\nA low pressure system will pass just off Vancouver Island Friday morning and move onto the Washington coast late in the day. Meanwhile, modified Arctic air will advance southward through the B.C. interior. By Friday afternoon, the Arctic front is expected to reach Kamloops and pile up against the east side of the Rockies.\n\nWith a somewhat cool airmass already in place, widespread snow is expected from the Chilcotin and 100 MIle area to the Fraser Canyon and eastward to the Kootenays. Snow may become mixed with rain over southern and eastern portions of this area. Currently, forecast snowfall amounts may range from about 5 to 15 cm.\n\nThe system will move out of the province on Saturday but Arctic air will make its way through the rest of the southern interior. Temperatures of 10 degrees below seasonal normals are expected.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-10-23T00:58:16-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-10-22T08:59:16-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3852628073.2020<br>Area: Highway 3 - Hope to Princeton via Allison Pass, Highway 3 - Paulson Summit to Kootenay Pass, Highway 97 - Clinton to 100 Mile House via Begbie Summit, Coquihalla Highway - Hope to Merritt, Coquihalla Highway - Merritt to Kamloops, Okanagan Connector - Merritt to Kelowna, Sea to Sky - Squamish to Whistler",
