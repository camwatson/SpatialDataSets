An atmospheric river will take aim at Vancouver Island and the Central Coast beginning early Saturday morning delivering heavy rain and mild conditions until mid-day Sunday. Rainfall amounts of 100 to 120 mm are expected by Sunday morning for the aforementioned regions.\n\nGiven the tropical origin of the atmospheric river, freezing levels will be on the rise upwards of 3000 metres for the South Coast and close to 2500 metres for the North Coast. The mild air will result in rain at almost all elevations. High runoff and rising river levels are likely through the weekend.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
