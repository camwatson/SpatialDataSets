				"Summary" : "Description: A ridge of high pressure over the northern Prairies continues to circulate a cool northeasterly flow to much of Saskatchewan. This cool airmass will lead to fairly widespread frost tonight with temperatures expected to dip to near or slightly below the freezing mark. Cloud cover over the southeastern portion of the province should aid in keeping temperatures above the freezing mark in those areas tonight. However patchy frost may be possible there as well if skies clear significantly. \n\nFrost advisories are issued from the Saturday of the Victoria Day weekend until September 30 when required.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
