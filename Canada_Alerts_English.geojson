It will then spread to eastern Quebec on Monday.\n\nIf the expected track remains unchanged, precipitation is expected to begin as snow, then gradually change to rain with a risk of freezing rain during the changeover on Monday morning over most areas.\n\nFuture weather statements will provide more details as the low pressure system's track as well as precipitation types and amounts become more certain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Stagnant winter weather conditions are creating elevated pollution levels.\n\nHigher pollution levels are expected to persist through Monday.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and ClimateChange Strategy in collaboration with Northern Health has issued an Air Quality Advisory for Valemount due to high concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5).  This advisory remains in effect until further notice. Exposure is particularly a concern for individuals with respiratory infections such as COVID-19, pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce fine particulate exposure. Restrictions on open burning are now in effect for all areas within Robson Valley Timber Supply  Area  until  November  23,  2020  at  9:00  AM  local  time.   Real-time  air  quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at www.bcairquality.ca\n\nMandatory Emission Reduction Actions: As pollution is occurring or is likely to occur from open burning, pursuant to Section 30 (1) and (2) of the Open Burning Smoke Control Regulation, the Director has prohibited open burning in the Robson Valley Timber Supply Area until November 23, 2020 at 9:00 AM local time. No vegetative debris may be ignited or added to ignited piles. Contravention of these provisions may be subject to a fine under the Regulation.\n\nVoluntary Emission Reduction Actions: Where woodstoves or fireplaces are the sole source of residential heat, burn dry woodand ensure an adequate supply of combustion air. Reduce the use and idling of vehicles.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-11-22T04:29:21-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
