				"Summary" : "Description: A wet weekend for Metro Vancouver  \n\nHeavy rain is in store for Metro Vancouver this weekend. An atmospheric river will take aim at Vancouver Island beginning early this morning delivering heavy rain and mild conditions until mid-day Sunday. The heaviest rainfall is expected to be near northshore where 40 to 50 mm are possible by Sunday morning. \n\nGiven the tropical origin of the atmospheric river, freezing levels will be on the rise upwards of 3000 metres for the South Coast. The mild air will result in rain at almost all elevations. High runoff and rising river levels are likely through the weekend. \n\nThe public is encouraged to monitor rainfall and wind warnings from Environment and Climate Change Canada as well as potential high streamflow advisories or flood watches from the BC River Forecast Centre.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.

				"Summary" : "Description: Persistent snow squalls are expected to develop. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nStrong and cold northwest winds blowing over relatively warm Gulf of St. Lawrence waters will make conditions favourable for the development of snow squalls today. Conditions are expected to improve later tonight or Sunday morning when a ridge of high pressure will move over the region.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
