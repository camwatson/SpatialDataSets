				"Summary" : "Description: A cold and snowy start to the week.\n\nA low pressure system over the Northeastern United States will bring snow to Southern and Central Quebec beginning Monday evening.   The snow will continue through Tuesday, reaching Eastern Quebec.   The morning commute will be difficult on Tuesday for the Greater Montreal area.   The snow will be accompanied by moderate winds possibly reducing visibilities. Close to 10 centimetres of snow are expected over Southern and Central Quebec by Tuesday evening, while higher snowfall amounts are possible over the Appalachians area.\n\nThe system will intensify and continue to affect Eastern Quebec on Wednesday, with snow, strong winds and blowing snow expected.   Snow will gradually change to rain over the Lower North Shore.\n\nQuickly accumulating snow will make travel difficult.\n\nHazardous travelling conditions can be expected due to changing visibilities possibly going from good to zero.\n\nThe public is advised to monitor future forecasts for more information as the low pressure system's track becomes more certain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A cold and snowy start to the week.\n\nA low pressure system over the Northeastern United States will bring snow to Southern and Central Quebec beginning Monday evening. The snow will continue through Tuesday, reaching Eastern Quebec. The morning commute will be difficult on Tuesday for the Greater Montreal area. The snow will be accompanied by moderate winds possibly reducing visibilities. Close to 10 centimetres of snow are expected over Southern and Central Quebec by Tuesday evening, while higher snowfall amounts are possible over the Appalachians area.\n\nThe system will intensify and continue to affect Eastern Quebec on Wednesday, with snow, strong winds and blowing snow expected. Snow will gradually change to rain over the Lower North Shore.\n\nQuickly accumulating snow will make travel difficult.\n\nHazardous travelling conditions can be expected due to changing visibilities possibly going from good to zero.\n\nThe public is advised to monitor future forecasts for more information as the low pressure system's track becomes more certain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
