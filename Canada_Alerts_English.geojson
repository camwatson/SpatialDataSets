				"Summary" : "Description: Hot weather will affect Southwestern Quebec over the next few days. It will cause high temperatures into the low to mid thirty degrees Celsius until early next week. Humidity will gradually increase beginning Friday and lead to warmer, more uncomfortable nights. The temperatures combined with humidity will give humidex values around 37.\n\nNote that temperatures will be a few degrees higher in the highly urbanised areas of the Montreal region. Discomfort will be particularly felt in these areas.\n\nDuring times of high heat, your health or your family and neighbours' health can deteriorate rapidly.\n\nThe ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux du Québec, in cooperation with Environment and Climate Change Canada, recommends that you protect yourself from the effects of the heat by taking the following actions:\n\nDrink 6 to 8 glasses of water per day. Follow your physician's instructions regarding the amount of fluid to drink;\nAvoid alcoholic beverages;\nIf you can, spend at least 2 hours a day in an air-conditioned or cool location;\nTake at least one cool shower or bath per day, or cool your skin several times per day with wet towels;\nLimit physical activity;\nWear light clothes.\n\nBe sure to:\nNever leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle or a poorly ventilated room, even for a few minutes;\nCheck on your loved ones, especially those who are vulnerable or living alone.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding your health condition, call Info-Santé at 8-1-1 or ask a health care provider. In case of emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\nFor more information, visit the Government of Quebec's Portail santé mieux-être at www.sante.gouv.qc.ca.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to QCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #QCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-06-18T19:24:43-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-18T03:25:43-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3413346653.2020<br>Area: Longueuil - Varennes area, Laval area, Montréal Island area, Châteauguay - La Prairie area",

				"Summary" : "Description: A warm air mass will affect the province of Quebec during the next few days. It will give daytime highs in the low to mid thirty degrees Celsius through Friday. Humidity will gradually increase beginning Thursday, leading to warmer, more uncomfortable nights. The temperatures combined with the humidity will produce humidex values of 31 to 38.\n\nDuring times of high heat, your health or your family and neighbours' health can deteriorate rapidly.\n\nThe ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux du Québec, in cooperation with Environment and Climate Change Canada, recommends that you protect yourself from the effects of the heat by taking the following actions:\n\nDrink 6 to 8 glasses of water per day. Follow your physician's instructions regarding the amount of fluid to drink;\nAvoid alcoholic beverages;\nIf you can, spend at least 2 hours a day in an air-conditioned or cool location;\nTake at least one cool shower or bath per day, or cool your skin several times per day with wet towels;\nLimit physical activity;\nWear light clothes.\n\nBe sure to:\nNever leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle or a poorly ventilated room, even for a few minutes;\nCheck on your loved ones, especially those who are vulnerable or living alone.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding your health condition, call Info-Santé at 8-1-1 or ask a health care provider. In case of emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\nFor more information, visit the Government of Quebec's Portail santé mieux-être at www.sante.gouv.qc.ca.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Humidity will gradually increase beginning Friday and lead to warmer, more uncomfortable nights. The combined temperature and humidity values will produce humidex values between 33 and 39.\n\nDuring times of high heat, your health or your family and neighbours' health can deteriorate rapidly.\n\nThe ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux du Québec, in cooperation with Environment and Climate Change Canada, recommends that you protect yourself from the effects of the heat by taking the following actions:\n\nDrink 6 to 8 glasses of water per day. Follow your physician's instructions regarding the amount of fluid to drink;\nAvoid alcoholic beverages;\nIf you can, spend at least 2 hours a day in an air-conditioned or cool location;\nTake at least one cool shower or bath per day, or cool your skin several times per day with wet towels;\nLimit physical activity;\nWear light clothes.\n\nBe sure to:\nNever leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle or a poorly ventilated room, even for a few minutes;\nCheck on your loved ones, especially those who are vulnerable or living alone.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding your health condition, call Info-Santé at 8-1-1 or ask a health care provider. In case of emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\nFor more information, visit the Government of Quebec's Portail santé mieux-être at www.sante.gouv.qc.ca.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to QCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #QCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-06-18T19:24:21-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-18T03:25:21-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1933212249.2020<br>Area: La Sarre area, Amos area, Lebel-sur-Quévillon area, Senneterre area, Rouyn area, Malartic area, Val d'Or - Louvicourt area, Ville-Marie area, Témiscaming area, Dorval Lodge area, Le Domaine area, Rapides-des-Joachims area, Fort William - Shawville area, Mont-Laurier area, La Minerve - Rouge River area, Low - Wakefield area, Maniwaki - Gracefield area, Papineauville - Chénéville area, Papineau-Labelle Reserve area, Lièvre River area, Saint-Michel-des-Saints area, Saint-Donat - Mont-Tremblant Park area, Mont-Tremblant - Sainte-Agathe area, Sainte-Adèle - Saint-Sauveur area, Saint-Jérôme area, Lachute area, Saint-Eustache area, Soulanges area, Vaudreuil area, Saint-Rémi area, Valleyfield - Beauharnois area, Hemmingford area, Huntingdon area, Berthierville - Saint-Gabriel area, Rawdon - Joliette area, Mascouche area, Louiseville area, Matawin - Mauricie National Park area, Lac-aux-Sables area, Shawinigan area, Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade area, Trois-Rivières area, Portneuf area, Valcartier - Stoneham area, Québec area, Côte-de-Beaupré - L'Île d'Orléans area, Bellechasse area, Lévis area, Saint-Lambert area, Lotbinière area, Gouin Reservoir area, Parent area, Lake Bouchette area, La Tuque area, Sorel - Yamaska area, Saint-Hyacinthe - Acton Vale area, Verchères - Beloeil area, Saint-Jean - Marieville area, Lacolle area, Bécancour - Villeroy area, Victoriaville area, Nicolet area, Drummondville area, Granby - Waterloo area, Brome-Missisquoi area, Richmond area, Weedon area, Thetford Mines area, Mont-Orford - Lake Memphrémagog area, Sherbrooke area, Coaticook area, Lac-Mégantic area, Cookshire area, Lac-Etchemin area, Sainte-Marie-de-Beauce area, Saint-Georges-de-Beauce area",
