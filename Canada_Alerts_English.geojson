Conditions will improve overnight tonight.\n\n###\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A strong winter storm will move from the Maritimes into Davis Strait on Monday night, bringing snow and strong winds to much of southern and eastern Baffin Island.\n\nThis system will produce wind gusts of 80 to 90 km/h through many communities Monday night into Tuesday. These strong winds may combine with snow to produce periods of near-blizzard conditions.\n\nSnowfall amounts will remain low for most communities, however moderate to heavy snow is possible along portions of the eastern coast on Tuesday. This snow may end up bringing higher snowfall accumulations to Clyde River and Qikiqtarjuaq. ECCC meteorologists will continue to monitor the evolution of this system and refine the snowfall forecast as the low pressure centre approaches.\n\nThe winds and snow will diminish on Tuesday night.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to NUstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #NUStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-11-03T02:55:40-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-11-02T10:56:40-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3419020336.2020<br>Area: Clyde River, Qikiqtarjuaq, Pangnirtung, Iqaluit, Kimmirut",

				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total amounts of 10 to 15 cm is expected.\n\n10 to 15 cm of snow Monday afternoon through Monday night.\n\nA low pressure system moving across the northern Prairies will bring heavy snowfall to northern Manitoba later today. Periods of light snow will begin early today across the region, then intensify late in the day. Heavy snow will move through the region overnight, easing early Tuesday morning. 10 to 15 cm of snow will fall with this system.\n\nFor areas near the Saskatchewan border, snowfall amounts may be slightly less, especially near (and south of) Reindeer Lake. In these areas, the snow may become wetter and \"less fluffy\" or even change over to freezing rain for parts of the night.\n\nThe risk for patchy freezing rain will spread southeastwards through the Thompson region overnight.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
