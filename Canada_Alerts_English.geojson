				"Summary" : "Description: A significant winter storm will affect southern Alberta this weekend.  The first system will cause snow in the Pincher Creek and Cardston regions starting Friday overnight.  The snow will spread northeastwards Saturday morning with the heaviest band running from Brooks to Hanna to Oyen.  About 5 cm is expected in this band, except possibly 10-15 cm in the foothills.  Areas to the south of the heaviest snow will see a mix of rain and snow.  \n\nAs the first system moves off, another round of snow will begin in the Pincher Creek and Cardston regions late Saturday morning.  This snow will spread northeastwards from Pincher Creek to Medicine Hat by Saturday evening, and taper off Sunday evening.  Another 25-30 cm of snow is expected by the time the storm ends.  Strong northerly winds are expected to create widespread blowing snow with blizzard-like conditions possible starting Saturday night and lasting into Sunday.  \n\nTotal snowfall amounts will range from 30-40 cm, with locally higher amounts near 50 cm possible in the Pincher Creek region.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Major winter storm to impact southern Saskatchewan this weekend.\n\nA powerful low pressure system will bring an abrupt return to winter this weekend. On Saturday, a early disturbance will begin affecting the northern grainbelt areas of the province, with 10 to 20 cm of snow expected for the day along with a risk of freezing rain.\n\nOn Sunday, the main system arrives, bringing more intense and widespread severe winter weather to the entire southern half of the province. Heavy snowfall will spread northeastward through the day accompanied by northerly winds gusting to 70 km/h or beyond. Blizzard conditions are possible and may continue into Sunday night. For the southeast, a milder start to the day will see accumulating rain and/or freezing rain also give way to the heavy snow with strong winds as temperatures steadily fall. \n\nWhile details in timing and intensity are likely to shift somewhat as the event approaches, current consensus indicates that 30 to 50 cm of snow will cover most of the watch area by Monday morning when the system finally departs.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to SKstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #SKStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-11-07T02:36:30-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-11-06T10:37:30-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0844646553.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Deer Forks including Burstall and Estuary, R.M. of Happyland including Leader Prelate and Mendham, R.M. of Enterprise including Richmound, R.M. of Fox Valley including Fox Valley, R.M. of Big Stick including Golden Prairie, R.M. of Clinworth including Sceptre Lemsford and Portreeve, R.M. of Miry Creek including Abbey Lancer and Shackleton, R.M. of Pittville including Hazlet, R.M. of Piapot including Piapot, R.M. of Gull Lake including Gull Lake and Tompkins, R.M. of Carmichael including Carmichael, R.M. of Lacadena including Kyle Tyner and Sanctuary, R.M. of Victory including Beechy, R.M. of Canaan including Lucky Lake, R.M. of Riverside including Cabri Pennant and Success, R.M. of Saskatchewan Landing including Stewart Valley, R.M. of Webb including Webb and Antelope lake, R.M. of Swift Current including Swift Current and Wymark, R.M. of Lac Pelletier including Blumenhof, R.M. of Excelsior including Waldeck Rush Lake and Main Centre, R.M. of Morse including Herbert Morse Ernfold and Gouldtown, R.M. of Coulee including Neidpath and McMahon, R.M. of Lawtonia including Hodgeville, R.M. of Glen Bain including Glen Bain, R.M. of Whiska Creek including Vanguard Neville and Pambrun, R.M. of Maple Creek including Maple Creek, R.M. of Maple Creek including Cypress Hills Prov.
