				"Summary" : "Description: Winter storm likely Monday into Tuesday giving 20 to 30 cm of snow.\n\nTwo rounds of precipitation are expected with this storm. The first one is expected to begin early Monday morning with 5 to 10 cm likely by afternoon.\n\nThe precipitation may diminish in intensity during the afternoon, but another round of even heavier snow is expected to move in Monday evening and persist until Tuesday morning. An additional 10 to 20 cm is likely. Northeast winds gusting to 60 km/h will result in very poor visibility in blowing snow.\n\nEven higher amounts may be possible in some locations due to extra moisture coming off Lake Ontario. Locally higher amounts may also occur on the higher elevations of the escarpment.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Precipitation will start as snow over most areas Monday evening then change to a prolonged period of ice pellets and/or freezing rain Monday night into Tuesday before gradually changing to rain from southwest to northeast across the province on Tuesday. Latest indications show a potential for between 4 to 12 hours of freezing precipitation possible for some parts of the province, with the greatest risk over areas furthest inland as well as the northern half of the province on Tuesday. Note that as this system is still in early stages of development, this situation may change and it will continue to be closely monitored as it approaches in the event warnings may be required.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total amounts of 10 to 15 cm is expected.\n\nSecond winter storm has arrived.\n\nOn the heels of a snow-producing storm on Saturday, a Pacific frontal system has arrived on the south coast this morning, spreading snow to the Metro Vancouver region. The snow is expected to become mixed with rain late this afternoon in some areas as another system reaches the region.  As is often the case, areas inland and those in the path of the Fraser Valley outflow winds particularly can expect snow to continue through Monday. Snowfall amounts will vary due to the timing of the transition and are likely to be much higher over higher terrain as the rain-snow line is expected to fluctuate between sea level and 200 metres tonight and Monday.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A period of severely cold wind chills continues.\n\nAn Arctic ridge of high pressure has allowed for a very cold air mass to settle over southern Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba.\n\nExtreme cold values of -40 to -50 have are expected to return again this evening. Some areas will combine light winds and temperatures near -35 while others will show warming with stronger winds, but all areas of southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba will be affected. \n\nAs the ridge slowly pushes East, extreme wind chill values are expected to gradually moderate towards seasonal normals beginning Monday morning for Saskatchewan. Most areas of southern Manitoba will have these extreme wind chills moderate throughout the day but are expected to redevelop for Tuesday morning.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nFor more information on cold and your health, visit Manitoba Health at https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/cold.html or call Health Links - Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Where appropriate, maintain physical distancing. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce particulate matter exposure. \n\nReal-time  air  quality  observations  and  information  regarding  the  health  effects  of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-02-15T11:45:30-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

Some areas will combine light winds and temperatures near -35 while others will show warming with stronger winds, but all areas of southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba will be affected. \n\nAs the ridge slowly pushes East, extreme wind chill values are expected to gradually moderate towards seasonal normals beginning Monday morning for Saskatchewan. Most areas of southern Manitoba will have these extreme wind chills moderate throughout the day but are expected to redevelop for Tuesday morning.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Where appropriate, maintain physical distancing. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce particulate matter exposure. \n\nReal-time  air  quality  observations  and  information  regarding  the  health  effects  of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-02-15T11:40:39-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

Potentially higher amounts of up to 10 cm may occur near Lake Erie.\n\nThe precipitation may diminish during the afternoon, but another round of even heavier snow is expected to move in Monday evening and persist until Tuesday morning. An additional 10 to 20 cm is likely.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
