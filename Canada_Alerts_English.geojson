However, from Webequie to Attawapiskat and south, the snow is expected to transition over to a period of rain late Saturday afternoon or Saturday evening. After this period of rain, snow will redevelop Saturday night before easing Sunday morning. At this point in time, forecast guidance suggests 10 centimeters of new snowfall can be expected by the time the snow comes to an end. However over northern areas where the precipitation will remain entirely as snow, up to 15 centimeters can be expected.\n\nThis heavy snow is associated with a strengthening low pressure system that will track across northern Ontario Saturday and Saturday night.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

For areas near and south of Webequie, the snow is expected to transition over to a period of rain late Saturday afternoon. After this period of rain, snow will redevelop Saturday evening before easing overnight. \n\nNear 10 centimeters of new snowfall can be expected for areas near and south of Webequie while further north, up to 15 centimeters can be expected.\n\nBy Saturday night, very strong northerly winds gusting up to 70 km/h will also develop, leading to reduced visibilities in blowing snow at times.\n\nThis heavy snow is associated with a strengthening low pressure system that will track across northern Ontario Saturday and Saturday night.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nSnowfall warnings are issued when significant snowfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Snowfall totals in the 15 to 25 cm range can be expected by the time the snow tapers to flurries Saturday night or early Sunday morning. Snowfall totals are likely to be less than 15 cm in areas that transition to rain. \n\nStrong winds gusting up to 60 km/h will also accompany the snow Saturday and Saturday night resulting in reduced visibilities in blowing snow at times.\n\nThis snow event is associated with a strengthening low pressure system that will track eastwards across northern Ontario Saturday and Saturday night.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nSnowfall warnings are issued when significant snowfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
