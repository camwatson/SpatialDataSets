Manitoba Infrastructure’s Hydrologic Forecast Centre has issued a Flood Warning for the Assiniboine River from Brandon to Portage la Prairie. \n\nIf you are in the affected area, be watchful as local waterways are expected to rise quickly and may cause flooding. There is a potential for overland flooding in low lying areas. Do not attempt to cross fast flowing waters or waters of unknown depth. Use caution when driving on all roads as road conditions may have changed. Avoid flooded areas. Follow all directions by local authorities, listen for updates and take all necessary precautions to stay safe.
