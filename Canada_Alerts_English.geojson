				"Summary" : "Description: Strong winds that may cause damage are expected or occurring.\n\nA deep low pressure system will track across the Gulf of Alaska tonight. A sharp trough extending well to the south of the Low will swing just past Haida Gwaii giving rise to strong southeasterly winds for adjacent regions of British Columbia. \n\nWe expect the winds to reach up to 100 km/h this evening over Haida Gwaii and North Coast - coastal sections for a few hours until they ease after midnight. These winds will quickly spread to Central Coast - coastal sections late this evening where they will persist through the night before easing early Wednesday morning.\n\n###\n\nHigh winds may toss loose objects or cause tree branches to break.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-01-29T04:58:59-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-01-28T12:59:59-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2003340674.2020<br>Area: Haida Gwaii, Central Coast - coastal sections, North Coast - coastal sections",
