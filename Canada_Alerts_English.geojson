Some of these thunderstorms may become severe and are capable of producing strong winds gusts up to 100 km/h, toonie sized hail and rainfall amounts in excess of 50 mm. There is also the isolated risk of a tornado near the Manitoba border.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.\n\nFor more information: http://www.emergencymanagementontario.ca/english/beprepared/beprepared.html.<br>Expires: 2019-07-09T10:53:44-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-08T22:54:44-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2687014080.2019<br>Area: Red Lake - Woodland Caribou Park, Ear Falls - Perrault Falls - Western Lac Seul, Sioux Lookout - Eastern Lac Seul, Kenora - Grassy Narrows - Whitedog, Sioux Narrows - Nestor Falls - Morson, Dryden - Vermilion Bay, Ignace - English River, Fort Frances - Emo - Rainy River, Seine River Village - Mine Centre",

Winds are light southwesterly which will direct smoke plumes to the northeast and east. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\nIf you, or someone in your care, develop symptoms, reduce or reschedule strenuous outdoors activities where ever possible until the air quality improves.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-09T14:22:38-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-08T22:23:38-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0771189575.2019<br>Area: Peawanuck, Sachigo Lake - Bearskin Lake, Big Trout Lake - Kasabonika, Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake, Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell, Summer Beaver - Wunnummin Lake - Kingfisher Lake, Pickle Lake - Cat Lake, Webequie, Fort Hope - Lansdowne House - Ogoki, Red Lake - Woodland Caribou Park, Ear Falls - Perrault Falls - Western Lac Seul, Armstrong - Auden - Wabakimi Park, Beardmore - Jellicoe - Macdiarmid, Nakina - Aroland - Pagwa, Geraldton - Longlac - Caramat, Manitouwadge - Hornepayne, Fort Albany, Moosonee, Fraserdale - Pledger Lake, Kapuskasing - Hearst - Smooth Rock Falls, Little Abitibi - Kesagami Lake",

Winds are light southwesterly which will direct smoke plumes to the northeast and east. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level.\n\nIf you, or someone in your care, develop symptoms, reduce or reschedule strenuous outdoors activities where ever possible until the air quality improves.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-09T14:58:52-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-08T22:59:52-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1172701157.2019<br>Area: Attawapiskat, Peawanuck, Sachigo Lake - Bearskin Lake, Big Trout Lake - Kasabonika, Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake, Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell, Summer Beaver - Wunnummin Lake - Kingfisher Lake, Pickle Lake - Cat Lake, Webequie, Fort Hope - Lansdowne House - Ogoki, Red Lake - Woodland Caribou Park, Ear Falls - Perrault Falls - Western Lac Seul, Armstrong - Auden - Wabakimi Park, Beardmore - Jellicoe - Macdiarmid, Nakina - Aroland - Pagwa, Geraldton - Longlac - Caramat, Manitouwadge - Hornepayne, Fort Albany, Moosonee, Fraserdale - Pledger Lake, Kapuskasing - Hearst - Smooth Rock Falls, Little Abitibi - Kesagami Lake",

Some communities could receive up to 75 mm of rain with multiple storms moving through the same region.\n\nLocations impacted include:\nGrassy Narrows, Redditt, Brinka, Jones and Willard Lake.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Very large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2019-07-09T00:41:18-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-08T22:41:18-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0754067495.2019<br>Area: Kenora - Grassy Narrows - Whitedog",
