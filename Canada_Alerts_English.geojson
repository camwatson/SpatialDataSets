North of this line the snow may turn over briefly to a mix of wet flurries and showers early this evening. \n\nAs cold arctic air returns tonight, snow squalls in a brisk northwesterly flow off of Lake Huron are expected to affect the region beginning tonight and continuing through Sunday. \n\nSnow squall watches have been issued for some communities.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
