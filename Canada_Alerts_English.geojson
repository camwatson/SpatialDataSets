				"Summary" : "Description: The warm weather that has been affecting the province of Quebec for the past few days will give high temperatures in the low to mid thirty degrees Celsius until early next week. Humidity will gradually increase beginning Friday and lead to warmer, more uncomfortable nights. The combined temperature and humidity values will produce humidex values between 33 and 39.\n\nDuring times of high heat, your health or your family and neighbours' health can deteriorate rapidly.\n\nThe ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux du Québec, in cooperation with Environment and Climate Change Canada, recommends that you protect yourself from the effects of the heat by taking the following actions:\n\nDrink 6 to 8 glasses of water per day. Follow your physician's instructions regarding the amount of fluid to drink;\nAvoid alcoholic beverages;\nIf you can, spend at least 2 hours a day in an air-conditioned or cool location;\nTake at least one cool shower or bath per day, or cool your skin several times per day with wet towels;\nLimit physical activity;\nWear light clothes.\n\nBe sure to:\nNever leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle or a poorly ventilated room, even for a few minutes;\nCheck on your loved ones, especially those who are vulnerable or living alone.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding your health condition, call Info-Santé at 8-1-1 or ask a health care provider. In case of emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\nFor more information, visit the Government of Quebec's Portail santé mieux-être at www.sante.gouv.qc.ca.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
