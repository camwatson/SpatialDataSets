Then along the Northumberland Strait of Nova Scotia through to Pictou County.\n\nAlong the Atlantic Coast of Nova Scotia large waves and rough pounding surf will affect the coast this evening.\n\n\nWind...\nStrong winds are expected to spread out some distance from Hurricane Dorian. Hurricane force winds are expected along the Atlantic Coast and eastern half of Nova Scotia with gusts to 120 km/hr and as high as 150 km/hr along parts of the coast.\n\nWarning level winds left of Dorian's track will cover the remaining parts of Nova Scotia, all of Prince Edward Island, southeast New Brunswick and the Magdalen Islands with gusts as high as 110 km/hr.\n\n\nRainfall...\nSignificant Rainfall can be expected for: western, central and northern parts of Nova Scotia; most of New Brunswick; and western half of Prince Edward Island. Rainfall amounts of 50 mm to 100 mm are forecast with the highest amounts possibly exceeding 150 mm.\n\n\nAs of 3 PM ADT Hurricane Dorian is located about 260 kilometres southwest of Halifax and is expected to make landfall this evening. Significant impacts have already begun for much of the Maritimes with heavy rain and strong winds already gusting to hurricane strength. Wide spread power outages can be expected to continue as the storms passes through the region. \n\nFor more detailed information refer to the Warnings and the Tropical cyclone information statement at https://weather.gc.ca/hurricane/statements_e.html.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Winds will increase late this evening and will become severe overnight and Sunday morning. Wind gusts up to 150 km/h are expected, especially along coastal areas.\n\n###\n\nThese winds will topple many trees leading to downed utility lines and extended service outages. Moderate to significant damage to roofing materials, exterior cladding and light structures is likely. This could result in some damage to docks and breakwaters. Shoreline erosion and wave overwash is expected where winds blow onshore.\n\nA hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected over parts of the region within 24 hours. Hurricane conditions include (A) sustained winds near 120 km/h or more, and/or (B) significantly elevated water levels and dangerous surf along the coast.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Wind gusts up to 150 km/h are likely, especially along coastal areas.\n\nFlooding is also possible along parts of the coast due to storm surge and rough pounding surf this evening.\n\n###\n\nThese winds will topple many trees leading to downed utility lines and extended service outages. Moderate to significant damage to roofing materials, exterior cladding and light structures is likely. This could result in some damage to docks and breakwaters. Shoreline erosion and wave overwash is expected where winds blow onshore.\n\nA hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected over parts of the region within 24 hours. Hurricane conditions include (A) sustained winds near 120 km/h or more, and/or (B) significantly elevated water levels and dangerous surf along the coast.\n\nBy nature, a hurricane also implies the threat of local flooding from heavy rainfall - consult your local area forecast for possible rainfall warnings.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Tropical storm force winds of 70 gusting to 100 km/h and possibly higher over exposed areas from Hurricane Dorian can be expected over the above regions.\n\nTropical storm conditions are expected to develop Sunday morning as Dorian quickly approaches the region.\n\nThe current track has Dorian moving over Nova Scotia this evening then tracking over the Gulf of St. Lawrence and then near the northern Peninsula Sunday afternoon. Winds will increase late this evening and will become severe overnight and Sunday morning. Wind gusts up to 110 km/h are expected, especially along coastal areas.\n\n###\n\nThis could result in some damage to docks and breakwaters. Shoreline erosion and wave overwash is expected where winds blow onshore.\n\nA tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds near 65 km/h or more) are expected over parts of the region within 24 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. Reports of storm conditions and impacts can be emailed directly to NSstorm@canada.ca or by tweeting reports by province using #NSStorm, #NBStorm, #PEStorm, #NLwx, #QCStorm or #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-09-08T23:51:52-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-09-07T17:52:52-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1692175167.2019<br>Area: Burgeo - Ramea, Bay of Exploits, Green Bay - White Bay, Northern Peninsula East, Port Saunders and the Straits, Red Bay to L'Anse-au-Clair, Chevery, Blanc-Sablon",
