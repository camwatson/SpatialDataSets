Freezing rain ending Sunday evening.\n\nWinds: gusts to 70-80 km/h in the Tantramar Marsh region this evening. Gusts of 40 km/h on Sunday over northern areas.\n\nLocations: Nova Scotia, excluding southwesternmost regions and northern Cape Breton.\n\nRemarks: rain and very mild temperatures associated with brisk southwest winds can be expected this evening. Temperatures will fall rapidly overnight tonight over northern areas of the province and over most other areas of the province early on Sunday morning. Rain will change to freezing rain or ice pellets over much of the province by early Sunday morning. These conditions are expected to persist throughout the day Sunday, although some areas along the Atlantic coast will change to rain as temperatures rise somewhat on Sunday afternoon. \n\nSignificant impacts from these changing precipitation types are likely.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.

This may lead to breakage of structures weakened by ice, such as tree branches and power lines.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.

				"Summary" : "Description: Rainfall, combined with melting snow, is expected. The frozen ground has a reduced ability to absorb this rainfall.\n\nRain heavy at times will continue into early this evening. Total rainfall amounts of 40 to 70 mm are anticipated by this evening.\n\nSince the ground is frozen, the winter rainfall warning criterion of 25 mm in 24 hours is being met.  \n\nThe rain will change over to freezing rain beginning this evening as temperatures dip to near the zero degree mark. Freezing rain warnings are in effect.\n\nNorthwesterly winds gusting to 50 km/h in some areas Sunday morning coupled with possible ice build-up on tree branches and power lines may result in local power outages. \n\nFor information concerning flooding, please consult your local conservation authority or Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry district office.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-01-12T15:01:10-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-01-11T23:02:10-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3522250593.2020<br>Area: Listowel - Milverton - Northern Perth County, Goderich - Bluewater - Southern Huron County, Stratford - Mitchell - Southern Perth County, Guelph - Erin - Southern Wellington County, Kitchener - Cambridge - Region of Waterloo, Caledon",

The extreme cold conditions will moderate south of Great Slave Lake and the Mackenzie River tomorrow morning as a weak system gives cloud and light snow.  However, regions north of Great Slave Lake will remain in extreme cold conditions for the next few days, and wind chills could approach -60 in areas north of Yellowknife.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
