This snow squall will likely remain over the area well into this evening before finally weakening tonight.\n\nUnder this snow squall local snowfall amounts up to 25 cm or more will be possible today, with additional snowfall amounts up to 10 cm possible this evening particularly for portions of Hamilton and Burlington. \n\nTravel will be impacted, particularly along portions of the QEW, where very heavy snowfall will result in reduced visibilities at times. Motorists are advised to exercise caution.\n\n###\n\nVisibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.

				"Summary" : "Description: Extremely cold wind chill values between minus 40 and minus 45 this morning.\n\nCold air remains entrenched over Alberta.  Cloud cover is moderating temperatures in some regions.  However, skies are expected to clear through the day causing temperatures to plummet once again. \n\nOver southwestern parts of the province, extreme cold is likely to return overnight into Sunday morning. \n\nThis prolonged cold snap is expected to end over Alberta by Monday.\n\n###\n\nWatch for cold related symptoms: shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle pain and weakness, numbness and colour change in fingers and toes.\n\nExtreme cold warnings are issued when very cold temperatures or wind chill creates an elevated risk to health such as frost bite and hypothermia.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A period of severely cold wind chills continues.\n\nExtreme cold will persist for a couple more days.\n\nAn Arctic ridge of high pressure has allowed for a very cold air mass to settle over southern Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba.\n\nExtreme cold values of -40 to -50 will return again Saturday night into Sunday morning, with light winds and overnight lows near -35 and colder forecast across most of southern Manitoba and Saskatchewan. \n\nExtreme wind chill values will moderate slightly during the day on Sunday, but wind chills of -40 to -50 will return again Sunday night into Monday morning.\n\nThese extreme cold warnings will gradually begin to end Monday and through Tuesday. However, although above warning criteria, wind chill values will be slow to moderate as temperatures ever so slowly creep towards seasonal normals through next week.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A period of severely cold wind chills continues.\n\nExtreme cold will persist for a couple more days.\n\nAn Arctic ridge of high pressure has allowed for a very cold air mass to settle over southern Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba.\n\nExtreme cold values of -40 to -50 will return again Saturday night into Sunday morning, with light winds and overnight lows near -35 and colder forecast across most of southern Manitoba and Saskatchewan. \n\nExtreme wind chill values will moderate slightly during the day on Sunday, but wind chills of -40 to -50 will return again Sunday night into Monday morning.\n\nThese extreme cold warnings will gradually begin to end Monday and through Tuesday. However, although above warning criteria, wind chill values will be slow to moderate as temperatures ever so slowly creep towards seasonal normals through next week.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nFor more information on cold and your health, visit Manitoba Health at https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/cold.html or call Health Links - Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Where appropriate, maintain physical distancing. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce particulate matter exposure. \n\nReal-time  air  quality  observations  and  information  regarding  the  health  effects  of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-02-14T09:02:45-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

However, although above warning criteria, wind chill values will be slow to moderate as temperatures ever so slowly creep towards seasonal normals through next week.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

This band of snow is fairly stationary and will continue to affect the area into the afternoon. The band may weaken somewhat as the afternoon progresses although additional snowfall is likely to move into the area by evening.\n\nLocal snowfall amounts of 25 cm or more will be possible today, with additional snowfall amounts of 10 cm possible this evening.\n\nTravel will be impacted, particularly along portions of the QEW, where very heavy snowfall will result in reduced visibilities at times. Motorists are advised to exercise caution.\n\n###\n\nVisibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility. Rapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
