These winds combined with the falling snow will cause significantly reduced visibilities in blowing snow. \n\nConditions will gradually improve Saturday evening.\n\nAnyone who needs to travel on area highways today should ensure that they check local weather forecasts (https://weather.gc.ca/forecast/canada/index_e.html?id=mb) and regional highway conditions (https://manitoba511.ca/en/) before travelling. Ensure that your vehicle contains a winter emergency kit (https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/sfttps/tp201012-en.aspx) in case poor travelling conditions cause you to be stranded for a period of time. Travel conditions have also deteriorated through the Dakotas and Minnesota, where this disturbance has also brought snow and strong winds.\n\n###\n\nVisibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
