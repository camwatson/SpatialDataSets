				"Summary" : "Description: Periods of snow are expected Saturday night through Monday morning, with the potential for significant snowfall Sunday night.\n\nThe first round of snow is expected to be fairly light. Snow will begin Saturday night with a few cm accumulating by Sunday morning. The snow will be wet and may become mixed with rain Sunday afternoon as temperatures rise above freezing.\n\nA more significant round of snow is possible beginning late Sunday afternoon. Current guidance suggests snowfall amounts near 10 cm Sunday night. \n\nHowever, with temperatures hovering near freezing the snow will be wet and slushy. If it is slightly warmer than expected, snow is likely to change over to rain.\n\nWhile there is still some uncertainty in the forecast, wet and slushy snow may make for a messy commute Monday morning. Power outages are also possible if heavy, wet snow accumulates on trees.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Elevated pollution levels are expected or occurring.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Northern Health has issued an Air Quality Advisory for Valemount due to high concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5).  This advisory remains in effect until further notice. \n\nExposure is particularly a concern for individuals with respiratory infections such as COVID-19, pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce fine particulate exposure.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at www.bcairquality.ca.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-01-23T02:26:13-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
