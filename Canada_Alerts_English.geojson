The largest threat is for strong wind gusts, and local  intense showers.\n\n###\n\nVery strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to NBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #NBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-06-28T23:59:23-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-28T15:41:23-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0288179543.2020<br>Area: Woodstock and Carleton County, Edmundston and Madawaska County, western half of Restigouche County, Grand Falls and Victoria County",
