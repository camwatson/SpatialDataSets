				"Summary" : "Description: A strong Pacific storm is on the way for this afternoon and Friday for the BC coast.\n\nThe storm will approach the coast today. Precipitation has begun over Vancouver Island and will spread to the south coast early this afternoon. Strong southeasterly winds will also develop this afternoon.\n\nInitially temperatures will be cold enough to allow some of the precipitation to start as wet snow  over Vancouver Island and higher elevations of the south coast. \n\nBy this evening warm air accompanying the storm will drive freezing levels and temperatures higher so that precipitation changes to rain for most communities. The exception may be Whistler and the Sea to Sky Highway from Squamish to Whistler where snow could persist longer.\n\nThe heavy rain and strong winds continue all day on Friday. The highest rainfall amounts will be over the central coast, north and west Vancouver Island. Areas of Squamish, northern sections of Metro Vancouver, and the Fraser Valley will also see significant amounts of rainfall.\n\nIn areas where snow does accumulate, a higher chance of localized flooding is possible due to rain on snow.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Periods of brief but intense snowfall are expected. Visibilities will be rapidly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow.\n\nA cold front tracking NW to SE through southwest Saskatchewan is bringing a short blast of snow, strong wind gusts of 60 km/h or greater, and blowing snow to the area this evening. As the front passes winds will shift to the northwest and visibilities will be reduced to near-zero at times in blowing snow. Conditions will improve later this evening.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
