A narrow band of around 5 cm of snowfall accumulation will stretch from roughly Brandon to Winnipeg to the Ontario border, with possible pockets of higher snowfall accumulations embedded in the main band. There is also a significant risk for freezing rain, over western Manitoba, the Red River Valley and points eastwards during the late evening and overnight hours. \n\nFreezing rain warnings may be required as the event nears and conditions are monitored.\n\nThis low pressure system will usher in a cooler, more seasonal weather pattern.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

There is also a significant risk for freezing rain, over western Manitoba, the Red River Valley and points eastwards during the late evening and overnight hours. \n\nFreezing rain warnings may be required as the event nears and conditions are monitored.\n\nThis low pressure system will usher in a cooler, more seasonal weather pattern.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
