The risk will remain through the overnight hours and into Saturday morning.\n\n###\n\nWind speeds inside the spray ring of a waterspout are 45 knots or higher. Vulnerable vessels are at risk of damage or capsizing. Keep in mind that waterspouts cannot be seen at night and may strike suddenly.\n\nWaterspouts are generally isolated in nature although they can also occur in families of two or more. Waterspouts sometimes appear as funnel clouds with swirling water visible near the surface.\n\nWaterspouts are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. Under favourable conditions, this weak rotation could intensify and become a tornado.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
