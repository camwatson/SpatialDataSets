				"Summary" : "Description: Strong winds this afternoon and tonight\n\nA low pressure centre is approaching Vancouver Island this morning. The low will move right over Victoria late this evening and then quickly move through the Lower Mainland overnight. \n\nThis afternoon, southeast winds will increase to 50 km/h gusting to 70 over communities near Georgia and Haro Strait, with southeast winds of 60 km/h gusting to 80 over exposed sections of West Vancouver Island. Behind the low overnight, winds will shift to west 50 km/h gusting to 70 to 80. The westerlies will ease Monday morning.   \n\nCurrently, the track and depth of the low suggest wind speeds will stay just below warning thresholds but some power outages are still likely.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
