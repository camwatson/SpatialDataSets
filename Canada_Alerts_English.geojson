				"Summary" : "Description: A snow squall watch remains in effect early this morning as conditions will be favourable for the development of intense snow bands which may locally reduce visibilities to zero.\n\nA significant drop in temperatures is then expected, which could potentially make some roads icy and slippery.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
