The track of this low is uncertain at this time, however it does have the potential to spread heavy snow over portions of southern and central Manitoba.\n\nCurrent indications are that snow will spread into southern Manitoba Thursday morning, working its way north throughout the day. It should end Thursday night in the south and on Friday in central Manitoba. \n\nA mixture of rain and snow could also occur in more eastern locales, again depending on the track of the system and how long the mild airmass remains in place.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The snow will begin early this morning in the south and work its way northward throughout the day. \n\nCurrent indications are that 10 to 20 cm will fall with this system, although local amounts could be higher. Some surrounding regions may also be added as the system moves in, depending on the track of the system.\n\nAs you go east, amounts will be less as the precipitation will be lighter and transition to rain. Localized areas of freezing rain are also possible, however the main impact of this system will be snow.\n\n###\n\nSnowfall warnings are issued when significant snowfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
