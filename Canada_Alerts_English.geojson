				"Summary" : "Description: Snow with a chance of a mixed bag of precipitation over the south beginning on Wednesday\n\nA low pressure system developing over the American Southwest will move through the New England States on Wednesday before lying over the Gulf of St. Lawrence on Friday.\n\nIt is still too early to determine exactly what will be the weather associated with this vigorous system. However, the projected trend suggests that this storm will cause a mixed bag of precipitation accompanied by strong winds. For now, north of the river, colder temperatures will likely favor snow, while in the south precipitation will likely turn to rain with a short period of freezing rain during the changeover.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts will vary depending on the evolution of the system's trajectory, but may exceed 15 centimetres over several areas north of the river and over the tip of the Gaspésie Peninsula.\n\nFuture weather statements will provide more details as the low pressure system's track and, as a result, precipitation types and amounts, become more certain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
