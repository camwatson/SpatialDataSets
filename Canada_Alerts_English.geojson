				"Summary" : "Description: Areas of brief, intense snowfall are expected near and after midnight from frontal snow squalls. \n\nA cold front is moving over the area and will result in low visibilities and a quick accumulation of snow. While snowfall accumulation should remain limited to 2 to 4 cm, heavy snow combined with blowing snow may result in hazardous travel.\n\nLake effect snow squalls from Lake Huron are then expected to develop Wednesday morning. Some of the snow squalls may give snowfall accumulations in excess of 15 centimetres by Wednesday evening, especially north of London and closer to Lake Huron.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Some of the snow squalls may give snowfall accumulations near 15 centimetres by Wednesday evening.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nSnow squall warnings are issued when bands of snow form that produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Areas of brief, intense snowfall are expected near and after midnight from frontal snow squalls. \n\nA cold front is moving over the area and will result in low visibilities and a quick accumulation of snow. While snowfall accumulation should remain limited to 2 to 4 cm, heavy snow combined with blowing snow may result in hazardous travel.\n\nLake effect snow squalls from Lake Huron are then expected to develop Wednesday morning. Some of the snow squalls may give snowfall accumulations in excess of 15 centimetres by Wednesday evening, especially north of London.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Total snowfall amounts near 10 cm are possible, especially south of Parry Sound and inland towards Bracebridge.\n\nAfter the cold front winds will become northwesterly and isolated lake effect snow squalls will develop to the southeast of Georgian Bay. Some of the snow squalls may give snowfall accumulations near 15 centimetres by Wednesday evening.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nSnow squall warnings are issued when bands of snow form that produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The highest snowfall amounts are expected along and north of the Trans Canada highway and generally south of and east to west line through Gimli. Snowfall totals in the area are expected to be in the 10 to 15 cm range. Snow will taper off over western areas overnight and eastern areas Thursday morning. \n\nIn addition to the snow, strong southeasterly winds gusting to 60 km/h will create reduced visibilities in blowing snow. Winds will increase over western Manitoba later this morning and eastern Manitoba later this afternoon then diminish throughout the region overnight.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The heaviest amounts are expected over the northwestern and north central grainbelt where snowfall totals of 10 to 15 cm are possible before tapering off this evening. In addition to the snow, strong easterly winds gusting at times to 60 or 70 km/h will create poor visibilities in blowing snow.

Snowfall totals in the area are expected to be in the 10 to 15 cm range. Snow will taper off over western areas overnight and eastern areas Thursday morning. \n\nIn addition to the snow, strong southeasterly winds gusting to 60 km/h will create reduced visibilities in blowing snow.
