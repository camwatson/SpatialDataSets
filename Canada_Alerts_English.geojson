Epsilon is not expected to have any direct impacts on Canadian land areas. However, swell waves are expected to build along the southern coastlines of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland Saturday night and Sunday. The largest waves reaching the coast are expected over the southern Avalon Peninsula where waves of 4 to 7 metres are expected. Over the south coast of Newfoundland from the Burin Peninsula and west to Port aux Basques, waves of 3 to 5 metres are expected. Along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, waves of 3 to 4 metres are likely. Some rain from a developing trough of low pressure well ahead of Epsilon will spread over southeastern Newfoundland Saturday evening, but the center of Epsilon will track well offshore near the southeastern corner of the Grand Banks early on Sunday.\n\nGale to storm force winds are expected over southeastern offshore waters. Over the southern edge of the Southwestern Grand Banks and the southern edge of the Southeastern Grand Banks, hurricane force winds will likely occur. Waves over the southeastern offshore waters are expected to be generally 6 to 9 metres except over the southern edges of the southern Grand Banks where waves of 9 to 12 metres are expected.\n\nThe Canadian Hurricane Centre will provide another update on Epsilon by 9:30 PM NDT Saturday.\n\n\nForecaster(s): Hatt/Couturier\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-10-25T05:35:13-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-10-23T23:36:13-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0679770575.2020<br>Area: Avalon Peninsula Southeast",
