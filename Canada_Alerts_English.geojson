Northwesterly winds of 50 gusting 70 km/h will develop over the south beginning this evening and expand northeastward into Saturday bringing blowing snow and blizzard conditions to the region. In addition, temperatures by Saturday morning will fall below the -40 degree Celsius mark, producing dangerous extreme cold wind chills in the -60 to -70 range.\n\nFor the south, winds will gradually ease through the day on Saturday ending the blizzard there. Further north, strong winds and blizzard conditions will continue into Sunday before diminishing. Finally, most sites can expect a second night of extreme cold Saturday night into Sunday before temperatures begin to moderate as well.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least 6 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
