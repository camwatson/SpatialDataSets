Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level. The smoke plumes may affect the regions into the weekend as the wind direction will be northwesterly or westerly.\n\nIf you or those in your care are exposed to wildfire smoke, consider taking extra precautions to reduce your exposure. Wildfire smoke is a constantly-changing mixture of particles and gasses which includes many chemicals that can harm your health. For more details, please consult www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-13T12:12:29-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-12T20:13:29-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1104894641.2019<br>Area: Sachigo Lake - Bearskin Lake, Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake, Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell",
