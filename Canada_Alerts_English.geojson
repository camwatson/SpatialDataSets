				"Summary" : "Description: A very warm air mass will remain over New Brunswick tonight and much of Saturday but will be displaced from northwest to southeast during the day as a passing cold front will cause temperature and humidity levels to decrease. Minimum temperatures tonight will drop only to near 20 degrees. Temperatures will again climb to near 30 degrees or higher across most of the province on Saturday, with humidex values reaching 36 or higher before the passage of the cold front. Temperatures will remain cooler for coastal communities along the Bay of Fundy due to onshore breezes.\n\n###\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions will be favourable for the development of funnel clouds today.\n\nA trough of low pressure has lead to scattered thunderstorm development over southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan this afternoon and evening.  These thunderstorms will have the potential to produce a few cold core funnel clouds, a few of which have been reported in the Shaunavon region.  The threat for funnel clouds will dissipate this evening as thunderstorms weaken with the loss of daytime heating.\n\n###\n\nThese types of funnel clouds are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
