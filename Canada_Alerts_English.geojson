				"Summary" : "Description: DUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR QUESNEL\n\n(January 22, 2021 13:00 - Surrey) The Ministry of Environment & Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with the Northern Health Authority has issued a Dust Advisory for Quesnel due to high concentrations of coarse particulate matter that are expected to persist until there is precipitation, dust suppression or a change in traffic patterns. Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nExposure is particularly a concern for individuals with chronic conditions such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, and diabetes; respiratory infections such as COVID-19, pregnant women, infants, and older adults. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Where appropriate, maintain physical  distancing. Anyone  experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce particulate  matter exposure.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at:                                                                                             \nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-landwater/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-01-24T04:00:12-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

Snow will begin Saturday night with a few cm accumulating by Sunday morning. The snow will be wet and may become mixed with rain Sunday afternoon as temperatures rise above freezing.\n\nA more significant round of snow is possible beginning late Sunday afternoon. Current guidance suggests snowfall amounts near 10 cm Sunday night. \n\nHowever, with temperatures hovering near freezing the snow will be wet and slushy. If it is slightly warmer than expected, snow is likely to change over to rain.\n\nWhile there is still some uncertainty in the forecast, wet and slushy snow may make for a messy commute Monday morning.

This advisory remains in effect until further notice. \n\nExposure is particularly a concern for individuals with respiratory infections such as COVID-19, pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions or acute infections should postpone or reduce strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as continuing eye or throat irritation, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, cough or wheezing, should follow the advice of their health care provider. Staying indoors helps to reduce fine particulate exposure.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at www.bcairquality.ca.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2021-01-24T04:00:24-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
