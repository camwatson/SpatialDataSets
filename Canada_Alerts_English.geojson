				"Summary" : "Description: Intense snow squall possible this afternoon.\n\nA relatively narrow, but intense snow squall is forecast to develop late this morning and then move across the area this afternoon into early this evening. \n\nLocally heavy snowfall will occur with this snow squall, resulting in a quick 5 to 10 cm of new snow. Strong northwesterly winds gusting up to 60 km/h will also occur this afternoon. These strong winds will combine with the heavy snow to result in reduced visibilities in blowing snow and difficult travel conditions over portions of the area. The snow squall is expected to move south of the region by this evening.\n\nMotorists are advised to exercise caution.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls and dangerous whiteout conditions today and tonight. \n\nWhat: \nWhiteouts due to blowing snow. \nTotal snow amounts of 20 to 35 cm locally; 15 cm today, 15 to 25 cm tonight.\nWind gusts to 80 km/h.\n\nWhere: \nBlowing snow will be most hazardous in open areas, such as along open fields. The heaviest snowfall accumulation is expected in an area that includes Kincardine, Ripley, Lucknow, Wingham, and Gorrie. \n\nWhen: \nNow through tonight. The worst period of blowing snow is expected this afternoon until midnight. The period of heaviest snowfall is expected this evening. \n\nDiscussion: \nSnow squalls will continue through tonight off Lake Huron. Widespread blowing snow with possible blizzard-like conditions is the biggest concern this afternoon and evening. Some areas may see heavy snowfall accumulation as well.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Road closures are possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2021-03-02T06:55:22-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2021-03-01T14:56:22-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2169295695.2021<br>Area: Saugeen Shores - Kincardine - Southern Bruce County, Wingham - Blyth - Northern Huron County, Listowel - Milverton - Northern Perth County, Goderich - Bluewater - Southern Huron County, Stratford - Mitchell - Southern Perth County",

Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for brief but intense bursts of heavy snow producing near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The worst period of blowing snow is expected this afternoon until midnight. \n\nDiscussion: \nSnow squalls will continue through tonight off Lake Huron and Georgian Bay. Widespread blowing snow with possible blizzard-like conditions is the biggest concern this afternoon and evening. Some areas may see heavy snowfall accumulation as well.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Road closures are possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Intense snow squall possible late this morning and this afternoon.\n\nA relatively narrow, but intense snow squall is forecast to develop this morning and then move across the area late this morning through this afternoon.\n\nLocally heavy snowfall will occur with this snow squall, resulting in a quick 5 to 10 cm of new accumulation. Strong northwesterly winds gusting up to 60 km/h will also occur this afternoon. These strong winds will combine with the heavy snow to result in reduced visibilities in blowing snow and difficult travel conditions over portions of the area. The snow squall is expected to move south of the region by this evening.\n\nMotorists are advised to exercise caution.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The heaviest snowfall accumulation is expected in an area that includes Kincardine, Ripley, Lucknow, Wingham, and Gorrie. \n\nWhen: \nNow through tonight. The worst period of blowing snow is expected this afternoon until midnight. The period of heaviest snowfall is expected this evening. \n\nDiscussion: \nSnow squalls will continue through tonight off Lake Huron. Widespread blowing snow with possible blizzard-like conditions is the biggest concern this afternoon and evening. Some areas may see heavy snowfall accumulation as well.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Road closures are possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
