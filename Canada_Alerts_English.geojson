				"Summary" : "Description: As of early this morning much of southern Manitoba remains under a winter storm warning as a massive low pressure system continues to relentlessly pummel the area with heavy snow and strong winds.  Widespread snowfall accumulations of 40-60 cm have been reported in much of western Manitoba and the western Red River Valley and many highways remain closed.  Widespread power outages continue to plague the region with significant numbers of downed or damaged trees.\n\nThe low pressure system will remain more or less stationary and hence snowfall and strong winds will continue, with further accumulations ranging from 5 to 15 cm over the course of the day. The snow will continue to be accompanied by winds gusting as high as 60 km/h giving near-zero visibility at times in blowing snow.\n\nTravelling will remain difficult if not impossible today as the heavy accumulating snow, strong winds, and temperatures near zero will result in treacherous conditions. Further downed trees and power outages are to be expected.\n\nThe storm will begin to weaken tonight, although a few areas will still see another 5 cm or so accumulation by Sunday morning.\n\nThe winter storm warning has been ended for Winnipeg as the worst of the system has now pushed west of the city.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-10-13T01:52:09-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-10-12T09:53:09-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0494652795.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Wallace-Woodworth incl.

				"Summary" : "Description: As of early this morning much of southern Manitoba remains under a winter storm warning as a massive low pressure system continues to relentlessly pummel the area with heavy snow and strong winds.  Widespread snowfall accumulations of 40-60 cm have been reported in much of western Manitoba and the western Red River Valley and many highways remain closed.  Widespread power outages continue to plague the region with significant numbers of downed or damaged trees.\n\nThe low pressure system will remain more or less stationary and hence snowfall and strong winds will continue, with further accumulations ranging from 5 to 15 cm over the course of the day. The snow will continue to be accompanied by winds gusting as high as 60 km/h giving near-zero visibility at times in blowing snow.\n\nTravelling will remain difficult if not impossible today as the heavy accumulating snow, strong winds, and temperatures near zero will result in treacherous conditions. Further downed trees and power outages are to be expected.\n\nThe storm will begin to weaken tonight, although a few areas will still see another 5 cm or so accumulation by Sunday morning.\n\nThe winter storm warning has been ended for Winnipeg as the worst of the system has now pushed west of the city.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-10-13T01:59:10-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-10-12T11:18:10-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0574481868.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Wallace-Woodworth incl.

This storm is forecast to track south of the Maritime marine district tonight, Saturday and Sunday. Gale to storm force easterly winds are forecast for the offshore marine areas south of Nova Scotia. \n\nMelissa will not affect land areas of Nova Scotia except for large waves and heavy pounding surf at the coast. Melissa is expected to weaken as it tracks eastward well south of Nova Scotia. \n\nAnother area of low pressure forming north of Sub-Tropical Storm Melissa will give rainfall to the Maritimes tonight and Saturday. Over areas of southern Nova Scotia, 25 to 45 millimetres are forecast. A special weather statement was issued last night for the potential for significant rainfall associated with this low.\n\nThis will be the only statement on Sub-Tropical Storm Melissa.\n\nForecaster: Hatt\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-10-13T01:25:13-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-10-11T19:26:13-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1469874865.2019<br>Area: Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Guysborough County, Richmond County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County",

				"Summary" : "Description: An extreme winter storm will continue to pummel parts of southern Manitoba into the weekend as a Colorado Low stalls over the area.\n\nThe most intense winter storm conditions continue tonight for areas north and west of the Red River Valley. The western half of the Red River Valley will be hit with an extraordinary amount of snow; 30 to 50 cm has been reported as of 8 pm CDT, and up to an additional 10-20 cm is expected tonight before finally tapering off by morning. Heavy snow has moved into the western Parklands and Interlake areas, where 30 to 50 cm is expected by late Saturday. Very strong winds will accompany the heavy snow, with gusts to 80 km/h continuing through Saturday as well. Stronger gusts of 100 km/h will be possible off of Lake Manitoba, the north basin of Lake Winnipeg, and in wind prone areas of the Riding Mountains.\n\nTo the east of the the Red River, precipitation has tapered off and the Winter Storm Watch has now been ended. For the City of Winnipeg, up to an additional 2-4 cm of heavy snow is expected tonight before tapering off late overnight. The strong winds will also steadily diminish tonight for these areas.\n\nTravelling will remain difficult if not impossible into Saturday as the heavy accumulating snow, strong winds, and temperatures near zero result in treacherous conditions. The combination of heavy, wet snow and strong winds will likely result in more downed trees and power lines.\n\nThis storm system will gradually weaken through the day on Saturday, and significant accumulations are not expected anywhere in southern Manitoba beyond Saturday night.\n\n###\n\nRoad closures are possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
