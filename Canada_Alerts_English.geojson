The snow is expected to become mixed with ice pellets Friday afternoon and possibly with freezing rain Friday evening, before the precipitation changes back to snow later Friday night.  At this time, forecast guidance indicates that the area of heaviest snowfall will remain just west of the Islands, but this could change if the track of the system bringing the snow shifts further to the east.\n\nStrong northeasterly winds Friday afternoon and evening, followed by strong northwesterly winds early Saturday morning, will cause reduced visibility in snow and blowing snow. Snow is expected to taper off to flurries Saturday morning.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Some inland areas may receive total freezing rain accumulations of 20 mm or more from this event.  \n\nIn addition, higher than normal water levels are likely along the Atlantic coast near high tide Friday evening.\n\nLater on Friday night, winds will diminish and shift to northwesterly as a cold front crossing the province brings snow flurries and a rapid drop to cooler temperatures.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and extremely hazardous. Extended and widespread utility outages are possible.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
