				"Summary" : "Description: Early August Heavy Rainfall for Vancouver Island and the South Coast of British Columbia.\n\nAn unseasonably strong Pacific frontal system is poised to drench Vancouver Island and parts of the south coast beginning today. The system will tap into subtropical moisture which will amplify the front and help to enhance the rainfall.\n\nThe main area of rain will begin over west and inland Vancouver Island this morning. The rain will spread across central Vancouver Island and over the Sunshine Coast later this morning and will become heavy at times this afternoon as the front intensifies. \n\nOver Howe Sound, Whistler, and northern sections of Metro Vancouver the main area of rain will arrive later this afternoon and this evening as the front moves southward. \n\nThe continuous rain will end overnight or early Friday morning as the front pushes to the east. In the wake of the front, there will be showers with a risk of thunderstorms and gusty winds through Friday. \n\nThere remains some uncertainty with respect to the location of where the heaviest precipitation amounts will occur. Stay tuned to Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest forecasts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
