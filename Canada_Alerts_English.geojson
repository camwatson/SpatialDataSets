Confidence is lower in this scenario, however, high enough to continue this watch.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
