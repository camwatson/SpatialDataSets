				"Summary" : "Description: A low pressure system approaching Baffin Island will bring several days of stormy weather to the region. \n\nThis weather disturbance spread heavy rain, heavy snow and some very strong winds to the south coast of Baffin Island overnight and the stormy weather will continue today. \n\nIn the Iqaluit region, strong east to southeast winds, gusting at times to 80 km/h, will develop this morning. A rain snow mix will persist for much of the morning, transitioning to rain this afternoon and persisting through Friday. \n\nRain and/or wet snow and very gusty winds will spread to Pangnirtung by Wednesday evening. Extremely strong winds, with gusts possibly in excess of 100 km/h, will occur around higher terrain near the community Wednesday night. \n\nThis weather system stalls near Baffin Island and then gets reinforced by the remnants of Hurricane Teddy late this week. Stormy conditions will last in some form until the weekend.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The heaviest rainfall amounts are currently expected for the North Shore.\n\nThis system will also bring strong southeast winds to the west coast of Vancouver Island tonight. As the system progresses, winds across the Strait of Georgia and surrounding regions will peak early Wednesday morning.\n\nThe combination of heavy rain with leaves on the ground may lead to localized flooding. Strong winds may also lead to power outages.\n\nThe wet pattern will continue with more rain expected Friday and Saturday.\n\nRainfall and wind warnings are now in effect for some regions, and will be updated as needed.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Heavy snowfall and high winds are expected.\n\nA low pressure system approaching Baffin Island will bring several days of stormy weather to the Kinngait (Cape Dorset) region. \n\nHeavy wet snow began overnight and will continue today. Although temperatures are mild, with the intensity of the falling snow, accumulations of 10 cm is possible. Along with the snow, strong winds gusting at times to near 90 km/h, will give reduced visibilities in blowing snow. \n\nThis weather system stalls near Baffin Island and then gets reinforced by the remnants of Hurricane Teddy later this week. As a result, stormy conditions will last in some form until the end of the week, albeit not as intense.\n\n###\n\nVisibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Winds are expected to gust to 80 to 100 km/h over exposed areas and along parts of the coast early this morning.  A period of very strong southerly winds gusting to 90 to 110 km/h will affect eastern mainland Nova Scotia and Cape Breton as the center of Teddy crosses eastern Nova Scotia later this morning.\n\n###\n\nThese winds could break tree branches potentially resulting in downed utility lines.\n\nA tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds near 65 km/h or more) are expected over parts of the region within 24 hours.\n\nBy nature, a tropical storm also implies the threat of local flooding from heavy rainfall - consult your local area forecast for possible rainfall warnings.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
