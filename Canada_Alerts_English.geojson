				"Summary" : "Description: A wintery mix of precipitation is expected for southern Manitoba beginning Friday and lasting into Sunday.\n\nAnother Colorado low will cross the northern plains starting early Friday bringing periods of snow and freezing drizzle to southern Manitoba. The mix of precipitation will begin in the southwest spreading eastward throughout the morning. There will be the potential for prolonged periods of freezing drizzle leading to icy conditions on sidewalks and roadways, though exact timing and duration remain uncertain at this time. This mix of precipitation will continue through late Saturday in most areas.\n\nPrecipitation will then shift over to mainly snow by late Saturday as the system tracks across the Dakotas. Current indications have the heaviest snow and strongest winds in the United States. However, areas along the international border and escarpment may see snowfall totals by Sunday morning exceed 10 cm along with reduced visibilities in blowing snow. The system will depart the area entirely by midday Sunday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls are expected to develop. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nConditions will be favourable for the development of snow squalls from Friday morning to Saturday morning.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Strong wind gusts will continue and gradually shift to northwesterly by Saturday night.  Coastal areas will have the greatest chance of seeing the strongest wind gusts.
