Strong southerly winds in advance of this system will begin to push precipitation over the St. Elias mountains and through the Chilkat Pass Monday morning. \nWe are expecting wet snow mixed with rain. However, heavy precipitation could  keep valley temperatures near the freezing mark, allowing snow to accumulate.\n\nAt this time a great deal of uncertainty exists in how much warm air will invade the Shakwak Valley and how heavily it will precipitate. If a colder regime presents itself, snowfall accumulations in excess of 10 cm are possible.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
