This storm will give significant snowfall amounts, strong to high winds and rain.\n\nSnowfall amounts in excess of 15 centimetres are possible locally over higher elevations of Central Quebec, the Lower St Lawrence and the Gaspé Peninsula. Moreover, similar amounts are possible from Les Escoumins to Sept-Îles.\n\nOver the tip of the Gaspé Peninsula and Anticosti Island, precipitation will mainly fall as rain. We could see between 20 and 40 millimetres of rain.\n\nSoutheasterly winds could gust from 70 to 90 kilometres per hour over the tip of the Gaspé Peninsula and the Lower North Shore on Monday.\n\nThe strong winds combined with the fact that we are currently in a period of high tidal ranges may produce breaking sea conditions at Gaspé-Percé, on Anticosti Island and on the Lower North Shore Monday.\n\nMore information on the development of this system will be provided as it becomes available.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
