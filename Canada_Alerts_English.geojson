Some of these thunderstorms may reach severe thresholds. This watch may be expanded to regions northeastward throughout the night.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to SKstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #SKStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-07-28T07:59:21-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-28T03:29:21-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3717034198.2019<br>Area: Buffalo Narrows and Peter Pond Lake, Île à la Crosse and Beauval, Hwy 165 between hwys 2 and 914 including Pinehouse Lake, Lac la Ronge Prov.
