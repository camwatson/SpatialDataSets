Snow accompanied by moderate winds may reduce visibilities locally in blowing snow.\n\nFreezing rain is likely in the vicinity of the snow-to-rain transition area. A more important episode of freezing rain is also likely for areas of the St. Lawrence Valley between Montreal and Quebec City. Travel could be difficult, especially at rush hour Tuesday morning.\n\nThere is still much uncertainty about the track of this system and thus about the type and amount of precipitation expected.\n\nPlease stay tuned for future forecasts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
