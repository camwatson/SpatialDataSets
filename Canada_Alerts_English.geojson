Overnight temperatures will remain near 20, providing little relief from the heat. \n\nHumidex values will reach the mid to upper thirties on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nHot and humid air can also bring deteriorating air quality and can result in the Air Quality Health Index to approach the high risk category.\n\nA cold front accompanied by showers and thunderstorms will move through Southern Ontario Wednesday night, bringing this heat event to an end.\n\n###\n\nExtreme heat affects everyone.\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
