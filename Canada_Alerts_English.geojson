Heavy snowfall rates of several centimetres per hour and blowing snow will combine to give poor visibilities at times. Conditions will improve later Thursday morning as the system responsible moves offshore.\n\nAt present, it is expected that the Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County region may avoid the heaviest snow and strong winds, but this could change if the track of the system and associated heavier snow bands shifts further to the east.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Freezing rain is expected or occurring.\n\nRain and freezing rain is falling from Slave Lake to Wabamun and is moving eastwards at 45 km/h. This is a relatively narrow band of precipitation however it is forecast to expand as it moves eastwards.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. There may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
