The snow may be mixed with or change to rain over areas near and south of Lake Nipissing. Brief freezing rain is also possible.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts of 15 to 25 cm are likely north of Lake Nipissing, particularly from Temiscaming to Marten River Provincial Park. North Bay will may receive 10 to 15 cm of snow, with significantly lesser snow amounts of 2 to 5 cm for areas just to the south of Lake Nipissing where more rain is expected.\n\nNorth Bay will be very close to the rain-snow boundary. A slight change in the exact location of this boundary will affect how much snow will fall at that location.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
