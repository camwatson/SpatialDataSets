				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls are expected. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nSnow squalls are affecting the area at the moment and are expected to move out this afternoon. \n\nThis snow is expected to be heavy at times and accumulations of 10 to 15 cm is possible. Strong winds and gusts of up to 50 km/h are expected to produce local blowing snow which could reduce visibility significantly.\n\n###\n\nVisibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nSnow squall warnings are issued when bands of snow form that produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2021-02-17T09:54:30-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2021-02-16T18:20:30-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0481692421.2021<br>Area: Sarnia - Petrolia - Western Lambton County",
