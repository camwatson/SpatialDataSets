				"Summary" : "Description: Elevated pollution levels are expected or occurring.\n\nA wildfire located east of Prince Albert and north of Melfort is spreading smoke over north central portions of the grainbelt. Air quality in locations down wind of the fire will at times be poor. Northeasterly winds today will gradually shift to the south on Thursday moving the smoke out of the area and possibly into north central Saskatchewan.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nPlease call HealthLine 811 for advice on health risks, symptoms and precautions associated with air quality.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-05-21T21:47:27-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-05-21T05:48:27-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2146626852.2020<br>Area: City of Saskatoon, R.M. of Spiritwood including Spiritwood and Leoville, R.M. of Canwood including Debden and Big River Res., R.M. of Meeting Lake, R.M. of Leask including Leask Mistawasis Res. and Parkside, R.M. of Shellbrook including Sturgeon Lake Res., R.M. of Duck Lake including Duck Lake and Beardy's Res., District of Lakeland including Emma Lake and Anglin Lake, R.M. of Paddockwood including Candle Lake and Paddockwood, R.M. of Buckland including Wahpeton Res. and Spruce Home, R.M. of Garden River including Meath Park and Albertville, City of Prince Albert, R.M. of Prince Albert including Davis, R.M. of Birch Hills including Muskoday Res., R.M. of St Louis including One Arrow Res. and Domremy, R.M. of Torch River including Choiceland and White Fox, R.M. of Nipawin including Nipawin Aylsham and Pontrilas, R.M. of Moose Range including Carrot River and Tobin Lake, R.M. of Kinistino including Kinistino and James Smith Res., R.M. of Invergordon including Yellow Creek and Tarnopol, R.M. of Flett's Springs including Beatty Ethelton and Pathlow, R.M. of Three Lakes including Middle Lake and St Benedict, R.M. of Lake Lenore including St. Brieux, R.M. of Willow Creek including Gronlid and Fairy Glen, R.M. of Connaught including Ridgedale and New Osgoode, R.M. of Star City including Melfort and Star City, R.M. of Tisdale including Tisdale Eldersley and Sylvania, R.M. of Pleasantdale including Naicam and Pleasantdale, R.M. of Barrier Valley including Archerwill and McKague, R.M. of Arborfield including Arborfield and Zenon Park, R.M. of Bjorkdale including Greenwater Lake Prov.
