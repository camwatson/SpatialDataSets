Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-08-01T13:17:25-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-07-31T21:18:25-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2981650799.2019<br>Area: Mackenzie Co. near Bistcho Lake, Mackenzie Co. near Rainbow Lake Zama Lake and Chateh, Mackenzie Co. near Zama City, Mackenzie Co. near Indian Cabins and Steen River, Mackenzie Co. near Meander River and Lutose, Mackenzie Co. near High Level and Bushe River Res., Co. of Northern Lights near Paddle Prairie Smt, Mackenzie Co. near the Caribou Mountains, Mackenzie Co. near Fort Vermilion, Mackenzie Co. near John D'or Prairie and Fox Lake, Mackenzie Co. near La Crête and Buffalo Head Prairie, Mackenzie Co. near the Tallcree and Wadlin Lake Reserves",

				"Summary" : "Description: Early August Heavy Rainfall for Vancouver Island and the South Coast of British Columbia.\n\nAn unseasonably strong Pacific front is poised to drench Vancouver Island and parts of the south coast beginning on Thursday. The front will tap into subtropical moisture which will amplify the front and help to enhance the rainfall totals.\n\nThe main area of rain will begin over west and inland Vancouver Island overnight. The rain will spread to areas of east Vancouver Island from Nanaimo to the Comox Valley, and over the Sunshine Coast on Thursday morning. The rain will intensify and become heavy on Thursday afternoon. \n\nOver Howe Sound, Whistler, and northern sections of Metro Vancouver there may be some scattered showers on Thursday ahead of the main plume of moisture associated with the front. The main area of rain will develop later on Thursday afternoon and Thursday evening as the front moves eastward. \n\nThe heavy rain will end Thursday night as the front pushes eastward. In the front’s wake there will be showers with a risk of thunderstorms and gusty winds on Friday morning. \n\nThere remains some uncertainty with respect to the location of where the heaviest precipitation amounts will occur. Stay tuned to Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest forecasts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Some of these thunderstorms may become severe giving large hail, torrential downpours and strong winds.This watch may be extended to portions of southeastern Manitoba later this evening.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Some of these thunderstorms may become severe giving large hail, torrential downpours and strong winds.This watch may be extended to portions of southeastern Manitoba later this evening.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
