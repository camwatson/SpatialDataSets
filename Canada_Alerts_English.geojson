				"Summary" : "Description: A period of very cold wind chills continues.\n\nAn Arctic ridge of high pressure has allowed for a very cold air mass to settle over southern Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba.\n\nExtreme cold values of minus 40 continue this morning for parts of central Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba. \n\nThese extreme cold values will moderate today. Extreme cold wind chill values near minus 40 may return again tonight into Wednesday morning for parts of southern Manitoba.\n\n###\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nWatch for cold related symptoms: shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle pain and weakness, numbness and colour change in fingers and toes.\n\nExtreme cold warnings are issued when very cold temperatures or wind chill creates an elevated risk to health such as frost bite and hypothermia.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Northeast winds gusting near 50 km/h will result in very poor visibility in blowing snow.\n\nEven higher amounts of snow may be possible, up to 40 centimetres, in some locations due to extra moisture coming off Lake Ontario. Locally higher amounts may also occur on the higher elevations of the escarpment.\n\nLocal blowing snow may persist until this afternoon.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.

Conditions are expected to improve Wednesday evening as snow tapers off to flurries and winds begin to ease.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Freezing rain is expected or occurring.\n\nA prolonged period of freezing rain is expected today. \n\nLocations: Nova Scotia\n\nTime Span: this morning through to this evening.\n\nRemarks: Snow and ice pellets will develop across the province early today, and will transition to freezing rain and then to rain from west to east throughout the day. The greatest impacts from the  freezing rain will be over inland areas and in northern portions of the province.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
