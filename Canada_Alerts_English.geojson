				"Summary" : "Description: Hot Spell for the Southern Interior through Thursday...\n\nA ridge of high pressure originating from the desert U.S. has set up shop over the BC interior and will stick around for the next couple days. It will produce the first spell of hot weather so far this summer.\n\nAt this time we don't expect to issue a widespread Heat Warning for the southern interior. However, the public is encouraged to protect themselves from the heat. \n- Drink plenty of water even before you feel thirsty and stay in a cool place.\n- Schedule outdoor activities during the coolest parts of the day.\n- Never leave people or pets inside a parked vehicle.\n\nCommunities will see daytime highs soar into mid-30s while overnight lows recover to the low to mid-teens.  \n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada's criteria for issuing a Heat Warning requires maximum temperatures greater 35C and overnight lows greater than 18C for two or more consecutive days. Many locales will reach or exceed the 35C high temperature threshold but most areas will drop below 18C at night. \n\nA reprieve from the heat will begin on Friday. The transition to more seasonal temperatures will be accompanied by thunderstorms.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Localized flooding in low-lying areas is possible. Heavy rainfall in combination with other weather factors, such as hail, wind and lightning will make outdoor activities unsafe.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
