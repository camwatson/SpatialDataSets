				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility in some areas.\n\nSome smoke is expected to push into central Alberta today and this alert will be expanded southward if smoke remains near the surface as it moves away from the fires.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-31T02:37:27-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-05-30T10:38:27-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.4104341342.2019<br>Area: Big Lakes County near Enilda and Joussard, Big Lakes County near Hilliard's Bay Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility in some areas.\n\nSome smoke is expected to push into central Alberta on Thursday and this alert will be expanded southward if smoke remains near the surface as it moves away from the fires.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-30T19:51:59-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-05-30T03:52:59-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2553871323.2019<br>Area: Mackenzie Co. near Bistcho Lake, Mackenzie Co. near Rainbow Lake Zama Lake and Chateh, Mackenzie Co. near Zama City, Mackenzie Co. near Indian Cabins and Steen River, Mackenzie Co. near Meander River and Lutose, Mackenzie Co. near High Level and Bushe River Res., Co. of Northern Lights near Paddle Prairie Smt, Mackenzie Co. near the Caribou Mountains, Mackenzie Co. near Fort Vermilion, Mackenzie Co. near John D'or Prairie and Fox Lake, Mackenzie Co. near La CrÃªte and Buffalo Head Prairie, Mackenzie Co. near the Tallcree and Wadlin Lake Reserves, Clear Hills Co. near Chinchaga Wildland Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility in some areas.\n\nIn central parts of the province smoke is expected to move back north by Friday morning as the flow shifts to southeasterly.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-31T06:07:09-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-05-30T14:08:09-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0725169204.2019<br>Area: City of Lloydminster, Yellowhead Co. near Cadomin and Robb, Clearwater Co. near Chungo Creek, Clearwater Co. near Nordegg and Big Horn Res., Clearwater Co. near Ya-Ha-Tinda Ranch, Brazeau Co. near Cynthia and Lodgepole, Yellowhead Co. near Minnow and Wolf Lakes and Elk River, O'Chiese 203 Res. and Clearwater Co. near Sunchild Cree Res., Brazeau Co. near Brazeau Dam, Clearwater Co. near Rocky Mtn House and Crimson Lake, Clearwater Co. near Caroline and James River Bridge, Lacombe Co. near Eckville, Lacombe Co. near Lacombe Blackfalds and Bentley, Lacombe Co. near Clive Alix and Mirror, Red Deer Co. near Sylvan Lake and Stephansson House, Red Deer Co. near Spruce View and Red Lodge Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility in some areas.\n\nIn central parts of the province smoke is expected to move back north by Friday morning as the flow shifts to southeasterly.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-31T10:23:53-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-05-30T18:24:53-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3725852475.2019<br>Area: City of Lloydminster, Yellowhead Co. near Cadomin and Robb, Clearwater Co. near Chungo Creek, Clearwater Co. near Nordegg and Big Horn Res., Clearwater Co. near Ya-Ha-Tinda Ranch, Brazeau Co. near Cynthia and Lodgepole, Yellowhead Co. near Minnow and Wolf Lakes and Elk River, O'Chiese 203 Res. and Clearwater Co. near Sunchild Cree Res., Brazeau Co. near Brazeau Dam, Clearwater Co. near Rocky Mtn House and Crimson Lake, Clearwater Co. near Caroline and James River Bridge, Lacombe Co. near Eckville, Lacombe Co. near Lacombe Blackfalds and Bentley, Lacombe Co. near Clive Alix and Mirror, Red Deer Co. near Sylvan Lake and Stephansson House, Red Deer Co. near Spruce View and Red Lodge Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility in some areas.\n\nIn central parts of the province smoke is expected to move back north by Friday morning as the flow shifts to southeasterly.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-05-31T04:23:02-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-05-30T12:24:02-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3302283862.2019<br>Area: City of Lloydminster, Lac La Biche Co. near Plamondon Hylo and Avenir, Lac La Biche Co. near Heart Lake, Lac La Biche Co. near Lac La Biche and Square Lake, Lac La Biche Co. near Lakeland Prov.
