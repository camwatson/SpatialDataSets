				"Summary" : "Description: A slow moving low pressure system in Montana pushed a swath of precipitation into southern Saskatchewan today which will continue throughout the night and into Saturday.\n\nThe main precipitation swath is forecast to remain over Shaunavon tonight and Saturday before weakening Saturday evening. Today, rainfall reports throughout the region have been between 10 and 30 mm. Tonight, another 20 to 30 mm of rain is forecast. On Saturday, before the system begins to weaken, areas in the region could see an additional 10 to 15 mm. \n\nFor Leader and Swift Current, radar indicates the swath of precipitation will remain over them throughout the night and into Saturday. These regions are forecast to receive 20 to 30 mm of rain tonight, and an additional 10 to 20 mm of rain on Saturday before the system begins to weaken.\n\nThe main band of the precipitation swath has moved out of the Assiniboia region, with only scattered showers remaining but no widespread accumulations. \n\nIt is worthy to note that within this system, there are pockets of heavier precipitation, therefore rainfall amounts will be highly variable across the regions.\n\n###\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
