The most intense bands are expected later this morning on Highway 11 between Lake Helen and Jellicoe.  Total snowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm will be possible.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Elevated pollution levels are expected or occurring.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Island Health has issued an Air Quality Advisory for the Cowichan Valley because of high concentrations of fine particulates that are expected to persist until weather conditions change. \n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. \n\nStaying indoors helps to reduce fine particulate exposure. \n\nOpen burning restrictions are now in effect for the Cowichan Valley within \n20 kilometres of Duncan City Hall for a period of 2 days. No new fires may be initiated and no additional material may be added to existing fires.  \n\nFor more information on burning restrictions, see the section  entitled ‘Mandatory Emission Reduction Actions’ and for more information on current air quality, see: \nhttps://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nExposure to air pollution is particularly a concern for children, the elderly, and those who have underlying medical conditions such as lung or heart disease.\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-11-06T01:08:04-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
