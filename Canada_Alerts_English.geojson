				"Summary" : "Description: High levels of air pollution due to smoke from forest fires will continue this afternoon. \n\nSmoke plumes are moving over the region from several forest fires located in the Sandy Lake - Pikangikum region. Air quality may deteriorate if the smoke descends to ground level this afternoon. However, increasing southerly winds have directed the smoke north of the area this afternoon. \n\nIf you, or someone in your care, develop symptoms, reduce or reschedule strenuous outdoors activities where ever possible until the air quality improves.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-09T11:17:17-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-07-08T19:18:17-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0979247574.2019<br>Area: Savant Lake - Sturgeon Lake, Sioux Lookout - Eastern Lac Seul, Armstrong - Auden - Wabakimi Park, Gull Bay - Black Sturgeon Lake",

Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
