The snow will taper to scattered flurries by noon on Friday for most areas, except by Friday afternoon in the north and northeast.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nBlowing snow advisories are issued when winds are expected to create blowing snow giving poor visibility to 800 metres or less for at least 3 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

A couple of these snow squalls are likely to intensify taking heavy snow and blowing snow well inland of Lake Huron.   \n\nSnowfall rates under the most intense bands may reach or exceed 5 centimetres per hour at times.  Some areas may see snowfall amounts in excess of 40 cm by Friday morning. \n\nVery strong northwest to west winds gusting to 70 km/h will combine with the snow to generate near zero visibility at times. \n\nWhile the snow squalls will shift slowly with time, this snow squall event is expected to last until Saturday morning.\n\nTravel will become nearly impossible at times. Motorists are strongly advised to change their travel plans accordingly.\n\n###\n\nVisibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.

Strong north to northeast winds will give occasional blowing snow late this afternoon and this evening. Over southern parts of the province, the snow is expected to mix with or change to ice pellets this evening. Extreme southern regions could see a brief rain-snow mix after midnight. All precipitation will taper to flurries by Friday morning.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nSnowfall warnings are issued when significant snowfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
