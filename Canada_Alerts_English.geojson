Dorian will make landfall near Halifax Saturday evening then move into the eastern Gulf of St. Lawrence on Sunday as a powerful post-tropical storm. Strong winds associated with Dorian will gust up to 90 km/h Saturday night.\n\n###\n\nThese winds could break tree branches potentially resulting in downed utility lines.\n\nA tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds near 65 km/h or more) are expected over parts of the region within 24 hours.\n\nBy nature, a tropical storm also implies the threat of local flooding from heavy rainfall - consult your local area forecast for possible rainfall warnings.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The current track has Dorian moving near Halifax Saturday night. Winds will increase throughout the day Saturday and will become severe by the evening. Wind gusts up to 150 km/h are now likely, especially along coastal areas.\n\nFlooding is also possible along parts of the coast due to storm surge and rough pounding surf later on Saturday.\n\n###\n\nThese winds will topple many trees leading to downed utility lines and extended service outages. Moderate to significant damage to roofing materials, exterior cladding and light structures is likely. This could result in some damage to docks and breakwaters. Shoreline erosion and wave overwash is expected where winds blow onshore.\n\nA hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected over parts of the region within 24 hours. Hurricane conditions include (A) sustained winds near 120 km/h or more, and/or (B) significantly elevated water levels and dangerous surf along the coast.\n\nBy nature, a hurricane also implies the threat of local flooding from heavy rainfall - consult your local area forecast for possible rainfall warnings.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The most likely track brings Hurricane Dorian south of the Maritimes on Saturday, making landfall near Halifax Saturday night. Severe wind gusts reaching 150 km/h are possible over parts of the province beginning Saturday afternoon and evening.\n\nFlooding is also possible along parts of the coast due to storm surge and rough and pounding waves.
