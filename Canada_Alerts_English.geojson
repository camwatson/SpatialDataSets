				"Summary" : "Description: Total snowfall accumulations of 5 to 15 cm by Friday morning.\n\nAn intense Pacific low and front brewing in the Gulf of Alaska this afternoon will approach the south coast on Friday. The system is sliding down from the northwest so there will be little warming of the cool airmass in place over Vancouver Island.  \n\nAs a result, precipitation will fall as snow over Vancouver Island beginning late this evening. Most communities will receive 5 to 10 cm of accumulation by mid-morning Friday. But higher elevation passes like Sutton Pass and Port Alberni Summit may get 15 cm or more total accumulation. \n\nPrecipitation will change to rain by mid to late Friday morning.\n\n###\n\nThere may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Temperatures are expected to drop to below the freezing mark on Saturday, changing the rain into freezing rain. Several hours of freezing rain may occur until temperatures climb to above freezing again on Sunday. This scenario is expected to result in significant ice accretion over these regions. \n\nStrong southwest winds gusting to 70 km/h are also expected Sunday morning, with the highest gusts occurring along the shores of Lake Huron. Strong winds coupled with ice build-up on tree branches and power lines could cause power outages in the hardest hit areas.\n\nRainfall amounts may reach up to 25 mm, although there remains considerable uncertainty at this time. Warnings will be issued as the event draws nearer.\n\nTravel will be impacted throughout Southern Ontario Saturday into Sunday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: 5 to 25 cm of snowfall accumulation by late Friday morning. \n\nAn intense Pacific low and front brewing in the Gulf of Alaska this afternoon will approach the south coast on Friday. The system is sliding down from the northwest so there will be little warming of the cool airmass in place over the Lower Mainland.\n\nAs a result, precipitation will fall mostly as snow over Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley. Snow will begin late this evening and continue until late morning, or midday Friday. \n\nTotal accumulation will be highly dependent on elevation and proximity to the water. The highest accumulation will be over the North Shore and the northeast sector of Metro Vancouver. The higher elevations of West and North Vancouver, Coquitlam, Port Moody, Surrey and Maple Ridge will get 15 to 25 cm accumulation by late morning. \n\nThe City of Vancouver and Burnaby will receive 10 to 15 cm total. \n\nAt low elevations and near the Strait of Georgia (for example, Richmond) accumulations will likely be up to 5 cm.\n\nThe Fraser Valley will see 10 to 15 cm total accumulation by midday Friday. The higher end of the range will occur north of the Fraser River.\n\n###\n\nThere may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The rain will then turn into a mixture of freezing rain and ice pellets on Sunday as temperatures fall rapidly over many areas. Rain could persist over parts of southwestern Nova Scotia throughout the day Sunday. Also, a change to snow could occur over Cape Breton Sunday morning. While it is too soon to provide specific details about amounts, significant impacts from these changing precipitation types are possible.\n\nAdditional information will be provided as the details become more certain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
