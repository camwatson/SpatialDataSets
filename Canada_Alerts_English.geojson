				"Summary" : "Description: Blizzard conditions with poor visibility in snow and blowing snow are expected or occurring.\n\nA deep low is moving across central Yukon early this morning. It will be followed by a rapidly building ridge of high pressure from the Beaufort Sea.  Consequently, east winds of 80 km/h with gusts up to 100 are occurring near the Richardson Mountains. The winds combined with freshly fallen snow will give blizzard conditions to the area. Conditions are forecast to improve this afternoon.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to YTstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #YTStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-11-10T03:36:38-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-11-09T11:37:38-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.4000420938.2020<br>Area: Dempster",

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA potent winter storm is bringing heavy snow, wind, and freezing rain to parts of Saskatchewan and Manitoba.\n\nA powerful Colorado Low will move through the Prairies tonight. Moderate to heavy snow will spread northeastwards through Saskatchewan tonight and continue on Monday across Manitoba. Snowfall totals as high as 30 to 50 cm are expected. Moderate northerly winds will develop and produce periods of reduced visibility in blowing snow overnight. Some regions will also see a mix of snow and freezing rain; consult local forecasts for more details on the location and timing.\n\nConditions will gradually improve from southwest to northeast later overnight through Monday.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Ice build-up may cause tree branches to break.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
