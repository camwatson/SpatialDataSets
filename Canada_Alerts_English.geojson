				"Summary" : "Description: A period of hot, humid weather ahead for southern Manitoba.\n\nTemperatures will soar for today and Wednesday across southern Manitoba. A warm front pushing into the region will bring a hot, humid air mass into the province. Temperatures will climb above 30°C both days, and humidex values will reach the mid- to upper-30s as the humidity increases.\n\nTonight, a breezy southerly wind combined with the hot and humid air mass will keep temperatures very warm through the night. In the Red River Valley and southeastern Manitoba, temperatures will likely only drop into the low twenties.\n\nA cold front will move through the province on Wednesday night, bringing a return to more seasonal temperatures and humidity.\n\nIn addition to the heat, much of southern Manitoba will see the potential for thunderstorm activity over the coming days. Some of these thunderstorms will likely be severe with a variety of threats. The humid conditions will support very heavy rainfall with some thunderstorms that develop. Areas in southeastern Manitoba affected by recent heavy rains may see more torrential rainfall; on Wednesday, the region could see narrow bands of training thunderstorms resulting in significant rainfall accumulation.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nSevere thunderstorms are possible across southern Saskatchewan late this afternoon and through the night as a low pressure system tracks into the region from Montana.\n\n###\n\nFast-moving water across a road can sweep a vehicle away. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
