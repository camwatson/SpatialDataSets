The rain/snow boundary will likely be across central New Brunswick. Rainfall amounts of 15 to 30 millimetres are possible over southern sections with 5 to 10 centimetres of snow possible for the northern and central areas of the province by Friday morning.\n\nAs colder air moves into the province from the north on Friday, flurries or periods of snow are forecast give an additional 5 to 10 centimetres of snow to central and eastern areas of the province. Reduction to visibility could create potentially hazardous driving conditions Friday afternoon and evening.  \n\nSaturday will be mainly sunny but remain cold across the province as temperatures will struggle to reach the freezing mark in many areas.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
