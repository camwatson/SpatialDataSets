				"Summary" : "Description: Temperatures reaching 30 degrees Celsius combined with overnight lows near 18 degrees Celsius are expected for the next 3 to 5 days.\n\nA warm and increasingly humid air mass is settling over Maritimes today and will remain into the middle of next week.\n\nMaximum temperatures today have reached or exceeded 30 celsius for much of the province, and Sunday is expected to be similar, with areas of southern and eastern New Brunswick reaching or possibly exceeding 30 degrees. Coastal areas may remain a bit cooler in onshore breezes. Nighttime temperatures tonight into Sunday are expected to range from 17 to 20 degrees, which will not provide much relief from the heat. Humidex values are expected to remain near or slightly below 35 over the weekend.\n\nIt is likely that the heat will continue into the middle of next week with an increase in humidity on Tuesday and Wednesday, when humidex values could exceed 36.\n\n###\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles.

Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops.<br>Expires: 2019-07-27T20:59:14-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-27T18:15:14-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3671079300.2019<br>Area: Fraserdale - Pledger Lake, Kapuskasing - Hearst - Smooth Rock Falls, Little Abitibi - Kesagami Lake",

				"Summary" : "Description: At 3:18 p.m. EDT, Environment Canada meteorologists are tracking a severe thunderstorm capable of producing strong wind gusts, pea to dime size hail and heavy rain.\n\nA line of thunderstorms extending from near Kesagami Provincial Park across Smooth Rock Falls to just east of Saganash Lake is moving slowly eastward and may reach the communities of Cochrane and Iroquois Falls between 4 and 5 PM. \n\nWind gusts near 90 km/h, torrential downpours giving 20 to 30 mm rain in under an hour, and 1 to 2 cm hail are possible.\n\nAt this point it appears the thunderstorms will pass by Timmins to the north.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops.<br>Expires: 2019-07-27T21:59:43-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-27T19:19:43-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2142816536.2019<br>Area: Fraserdale - Pledger Lake, Kapuskasing - Hearst - Smooth Rock Falls, Little Abitibi - Kesagami Lake, Timmins - Cochrane - Iroquois Falls",

Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.\n\nFor more information: http://www.emergencymanagementontario.ca/english/beprepared/beprepared.html.<br>Expires: 2019-07-28T05:59:07-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-27T18:07:07-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1059237291.2019<br>Area: Fraserdale - Pledger Lake, Kapuskasing - Hearst - Smooth Rock Falls, Little Abitibi - Kesagami Lake, Timmins - Cochrane - Iroquois Falls, Gogama - Foleyet, Kirkland Lake - Englehart, New Liskeard - Temagami",

Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-28T09:30:10-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-07-27T17:31:10-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0468694553.2019<br>Area: Mackenzie Co. near Bistcho Lake, Mackenzie Co. near Rainbow Lake Zama Lake and Chateh, Mackenzie Co. near Zama City, Mackenzie Co. near Indian Cabins and Steen River, Mackenzie Co. near Meander River and Lutose, Mackenzie Co. near High Level and Bushe River Res., Co. of Northern Lights near Paddle Prairie Smt, Mackenzie Co. near the Caribou Mountains, Mackenzie Co. near Fort Vermilion, Mackenzie Co. near John D'or Prairie and Fox Lake, Mackenzie Co. near La Crête and Buffalo Head Prairie, Mackenzie Co. near the Tallcree and Wadlin Lake Reserves",
