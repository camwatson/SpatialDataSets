				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions will be favourable for the development of funnel clouds today.\n\n\n###\n\nThese types of funnel clouds are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nIf conditions become more favourable for the development of landspout tornadoes, watches and warnings will be issued by Environment Canada.\n\nLandspout tornadoes do not usually cause significant damage but can still be dangerous. They can be strong enough to topple trees, damage roofs or toss debris short distances.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to SKstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #SKStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-19T05:15:24-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-18T17:16:24-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3912471428.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Hudson Bay including Shoal Lake and Red Earth Reserves, R.M. of Hudson Bay including Hudson Bay and Reserve, R.M. of Porcupine including Porcupine Plain and Weekes, R.M. of Hazel Dell including Lintlaw and Hazel Dell, R.M. of Preeceville including Preeceville and Sturgis, R.M. of Invermay including Invermay and Rama, R.M. of Buchanan including Buchanan Amsterdam and Tadmore, R.M. of Insinger including Theodore and Sheho, R.M. of Good Lake including Canora and Good Spirit Lake Prov.

Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nChildren, including teenagers, are at higher risk from outdoor air pollution because they often spend time being active outdoors. Young people are more likely to have asthma and their lungs are still developing.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-07-19T06:00:46-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2020-07-18T14:01:46-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3327123730.2020<br>Area: Watford - Pinery Park - Eastern Lambton County, Sarnia - Petrolia - Western Lambton County, Chatham-Kent - Rondeau Park, Windsor - Leamington - Essex County",
