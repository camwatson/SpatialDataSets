Snow squalls are expected to occur inland, mainly affecting the Burgeo Highway, with just a few flurries along the south coast.\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow with just a few kilometres are common.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
