				"Summary" : "Description: Potential snow for the BC South Coast Thursday night\n\nWith the shift into cooler weather, snow is looking likely over the BC South Coast in the coming week. While there may be a few light flurries mixed with rain tonight, the first real opportunity for widespread low elevation snow is shaping up to be Thursday night.\n\nA low tracking south along the BC coast will spread moisture across the BC South Coast beginning Thursday evening. With temperatures hovering near the freezing mark, a mix of rain or snow is possible across the region. \n\nAs is frequently the case, snowfall amounts will vary across the region. Current estimates are that the Fraser Valley, and higher elevations of Metro Vancouver and Vancouver Island have the the potential for snowfall accumulations to exceed 5 cm Thursday night. \n\nThe snow is expected to change back to rain Friday morning. However, with temperatures remaining below seasonal normals into next week, the chance of more snow remains.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Total snowfall of 20 to 35 cm is expected by Thursday morning, with higher amounts possible over the Cape Breton Highlands. Additionally, strong northerly winds will develop giving reduced visibility in blowing snow.\n\nHigher than normal water levels are expected at high tide this afternoon or evening along the Cape Breton coastline and the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total amounts of 10 to 15 cm is expected.\n\nA low pressure system tracking eastward across southern Saskatchewan will bring snow to a large portion of southern Saskatchewan today. The heaviest amounts are expected over the northwestern and north-central grainbelt where snowfall totals of 10 to 15 cm are possible before tapering off this evening. In addition to the snow, strong easterly winds gusting at times to 70 km/h will create poor visibilities in blowing snow. Winds are expected to diminish this afternoon.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-01-09T06:02:20-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-01-08T16:47:18-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3852270253.2020<br>Area: Midland - Coldwater - Orr Lake, Orillia - Lagoon City - Washago, Bruce Peninsula - Sauble Beach - Tobermory, Owen Sound - Blue Mountains - Northern Grey County, Shelburne - Mansfield - Northern Dufferin County, Orangeville - Grand Valley - Southern Dufferin County",
