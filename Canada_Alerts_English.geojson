The mix of precipitation will begin in the southwest spreading eastward throughout the morning. There will be the potential for prolonged periods of freezing drizzle leading to icy conditions on sidewalks and roadways, though exact timing and duration remain uncertain at this time. This mix of precipitation will continue through late Saturday in most areas.\n\nPrecipitation will then shift over to mainly snow by late Saturday as the system tracks across the Dakotas. Current indications have the heaviest snow and strongest winds in the United States. However, areas along the international border as well as the Manitoba escarpment may see snowfall totals exceed 10 cm by Sunday morning. Reduced visibilities in snow and blowing snow are also possible. The system will depart the area entirely by midday Sunday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nFlurries at times heavy are expected.

Snow squalls with\n         locally poor visibility are likely as well.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A wintery mix of precipitation is expected for southern Manitoba beginning early Friday and lasting into Sunday.\n\nAnother Colorado low will cross the northern plains starting early Friday bringing periods of snow and freezing drizzle to southern Manitoba. The mix of precipitation will begin in the southwest spreading eastward throughout the morning. There will be the potential for prolonged periods of freezing drizzle leading to icy conditions on sidewalks and roadways, though exact timing and duration remain uncertain at this time. This mix of precipitation will continue through late Saturday in most areas.\n\nPrecipitation will then shift over to mainly snow by late Saturday as the system tracks across the Dakotas. Current indications have the heaviest snow and strongest winds in the United States. However, areas along the international border as well as the Manitoba escarpment may see snowfall totals exceed 10 cm by Sunday morning. Reduced visibilities in snow and blowing snow are also possible. The system will depart the area entirely by midday Sunday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
