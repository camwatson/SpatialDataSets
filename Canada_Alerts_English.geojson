				"Summary" : "Description: Snow, ice pellets, and a prolonged period of freezing rain is possible this weekend. \n\nHazards: \nFreezing rain, possibly lasting several hours.\n3-8 mm of ice accretion.\nLocal power outages and slippery surfaces.\n\nTiming: \nPrecipitation will begin Saturday morning and last into Sunday. \n\nDiscussion:\nAn approaching system will bring a transition zone of precipitation with it from roughly the Dundalk Highlands east to Ottawa and eastern Ontario. Along this zone, several hours of freezing rain may be possible, favouring ice build up on untreated surfaces and power lines. Precipitation will likely include a mix of rain, snow, ice pellets, and freezing rain. Snowfall accumulations are generally anticipated to be limited to 5 cm or less. \n\nFreezing Rain Warnings will be considered as this event draws nearer.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow, ice pellets, and a prolonged period of freezing rain is possible this weekend. \n\nHazards: \nFreezing rain, possibly lasting several hours\n3-8 mm of ice accretion\nLocal power outages and slippery surfaces\n\nTiming: \nPrecipitation will begin Saturday morning and last into Sunday. \n\nDiscussion:\nAn approaching system will bring a transition zone of precipitation with it from roughly the Dundalk Highlands east to Ottawa and eastern Ontario. Along this zone, several hours of freezing rain may be possible, favouring ice build up on untreated surfaces and power lines. Precipitation will likely include a mix of rain, snow, ice pellets, and freezing rain. Snowfall accumulations are generally anticipated to be limited to 5 cm or less. A Freezing Rain Warning will be considered as this event draws nearer.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

This system will intensify as it approaches the province.\n\nA mixed bag of precipitation will accompany this system. Generally, regions to the north and east will see significant snowfall amounts. An area of freezing rain could also affect part of the province from Saturday evening to Sunday morning, especially regions just north of Montreal and areas along the St. Lawrence River toward Quebec City.\n\nPoor driving conditions are expected.\nConsider modifying any non-essential travel plans.\n\nFor the moment, the low pressure system's track remains fairly uncertain. The exact types and amounts of expected precipitation will depend on this track.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Precipitation may be mixed with snow Friday overnight and early Saturday morning.\n\nDiscussion:\nThis rain or freezing rain is a result of an approaching Texas low that will spread precipitation across a large portion of southern Ontario and parts of northeastern Ontario beginning Friday overnight. \n\nRainfall warnings or freezing rain warnings will be considered as the event draws nearer.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
