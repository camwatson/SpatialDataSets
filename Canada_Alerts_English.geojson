				"Summary" : "Description: Localized plumes of dense smoke are expected to redevelop this afternoon as a ridge of high pressure moves through the region.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nIf your home is not air-conditioned, be sure the house doesn't get too warm when doors and windows are closed to keep out smoke. Exposure to too much heat can also result in illness.\n\nIn general, wearing a mask is not the best way to protect your health during a smoke event. In fact, masks may lead to a false sense of security, which may encourage increased physical activity and time spent outdoors, meaning increased exposure to smoke. They can also make breathing more difficult.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nDue to the smoky conditions, individuals living in or travelling to the above noted areas are advised to be aware of potential health concerns that can be associated with current air conditions. In these current conditions, even healthy individuals may experience sore eyes, tears, coughing and a runny nose.\n\nIn areas affected by smoke from wildland fires, Manitobans are encouraged to:\n- limit outdoor activity and/or strenuous physical activity; if breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce the activity\n- reduce exposure to smoke by staying indoors or moving to areas with cleaner air, as conditions can vary dramatically by area\n- turn off furnaces and air-conditioning units that may draw smoke indoors\n- keep indoor air cleaner by avoiding smoking or burning other materials \n\nPeople at higher risk include young children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with heart or lung conditions (particularly asthma), and therefore should avoid as much exposure to smoke as possible.\n\nManitobans with health questions or concerns can contact their health-care provider or call Health Links – Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257. More information on the health effects of smoke is available at www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/smoke.html.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-13T01:01:52-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Manitoba Health, 2019-07-12T09:02:52-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2615543487.2019<br>Area: Oxford House and Gods Lake, Red Sucker Lake, Island Lake",

Showers are expected to end today and the wind direction will become northwesterly midday so a shift in the smoke plumes is expected. The smoke plumes may affect the regions into the weekend.\n\nIf you or those in your care are exposed to wildfire smoke, consider taking extra precautions to reduce your exposure. Wildfire smoke is a constantly-changing mixture of particles and gasses which includes many chemicals that can harm your health. For more details, please consult www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke.html.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath.

				"Summary" : "Description: Elevated pollution levels are expected or occurring.\n\nAIR QUALITY ADVISORY FOR YUKON\n\nThe office of the Yukon Chief Medical Officer of Health has issued an Air Quality Advisory for all Yukon communities due to high or increasing concentrations of wildfire smoke.\n\nWildfires in Alaska and central Yukon are causing increased concentrations of smoke throughout the territory. Local conditions may also affect the concentration of smoke in each community.  Please note that there is no immediate wildfire threat to any Yukon communities.\n\nSmoke can impact your health if it lingers in your community. Please observe the following recommendations: \n\n- You may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, eye or throat irritation, or shortness of breath. If you are experiencing symptoms, limit outdoor activity and/or strenuous physical activity; if breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce the activity.\n\n-\tMake sure you identify and support those who are at increased risk from wildfire smoke. These include small children, elders, pregnant women, and those with lung or heart disease.\n\n-\tIf you have a health condition that could worsen with the smoke (asthma, chronic lung disease or COPD, or heart disease) check in with your health care provider to make sure that you have a plan for managing your condition. Make sure your medications and supplies are available and up-to-date. \n\n-\tReduce exposure to smoky air by staying indoors and turning on an air cleaner with a HEPA filter, if you have one. Keep indoor air as clean as possible by avoiding smoking or burning other materials.\n\n-\tIf your symptoms worsen or you are concerned about your health or the health of a friend/family member, contact the health line at 811, contact your health care provider, or go to your Community Health Centre or hospital emergency department.\n\n-\tFor advice about keeping your home air clean and cool visit www.hss.gov.yk.ca/wildfiresmoke.php\n\n-\tTo view an hourly forecast of smoke conditions in Yukon, visit www.firesmoke.ca/forecasts/current\n\n###\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-12T18:45:31-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Government of Yukon, 2019-07-12T02:46:31-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1984725966.2019<br>Area: Dawson, Mayo, Beaver Creek, Pelly - Carmacks, Kluane Lake, Haines Junction, Whitehorse, Teslin Y.T., Cassiar Mountains Y.T., Watson Lake Y.T., Faro - Ross River, Dempster, Old Crow",
