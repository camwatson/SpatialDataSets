				"Summary" : "Description: Winter Weather Travel Advisory in effect for today and tonight. \n\nWhat: \nSnow. Total amounts of 5 to 15 cm are expected by Friday morning.\n\nWhere: \nPortions of the Greater Toronto Area, particularly downtown Toronto, southern Etobicoke, Mississauga, Milton, and Oakville. \nThis includes sections of the following highways: \n-Highway 403\n-Highway 407\n-Highway 427\n-Queen Elizabeth Way\n-Gardiner Expressway\n\nWhen: \nMidday today through Friday morning. The steadiest snowfall is expected this evening. \n\nDiscussion: \nLake enhanced snowfall is expected to locally boost snowfall amounts to 10 to 15 cm in parts of the west end of the Greater Toronto Area. Accumulating snow could cause poor driving conditions, and impact the commute this evening and Friday morning. The localized nature of lake enhanced snow means that snowfall intensity and accumulations may vary considerably between nearby locations. \n\nActions:\nDrivers should plan to give themselves extra time to reach their destination.\nIf visibility is reduced while driving, slow down, watch for tail lights ahead and be prepared to stop.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
