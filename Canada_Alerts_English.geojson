Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nChildren, including teenagers, are at higher risk from outdoor air pollution because they often spend time being active outdoors.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions will be favourable for the development of funnel clouds today.\n\n\n###\n\nThese types of funnel clouds are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nIf conditions become more favourable for the development of landspout tornadoes, watches and warnings will be issued by Environment Canada.\n\nLandspout tornadoes do not usually cause significant damage but can still be dangerous. They can be strong enough to topple trees, damage roofs or toss debris short distances.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
