As appropriate, follow your physician's instructions regarding the amount of fluid to drink; Avoid alcoholic beverages; Spend at least 2 hours a day in an air conditioned or cool place; Take at least one cool shower or bath per day, or cool your skin several times per day with wet towels; Limit physical activity; Wear light clothes.  \n\nBe sure to: \nNever leave a child or a baby alone in a vehicle or a poorly ventilated room, even for a few minutes; Check on your loved ones, especially those who are vulnerable or living alone.  \n\nIf you have any questions regarding your health, call Info-Santé by dialing 8-1-1 or ask a health care provider. In case of emergency, call 9-1-1.  \n\nFor more information, visit the Government of Quebec's Portail santé mieux-être at www.sante.gouv.qc.ca.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A period of hot weather continues.\n\nDaytime high temperatures in excess of 30 degrees Celsius, with humidex values in the high thirties to low forties, are expected. Overnight lows near 20 degrees Celsius are also expected through this period, providing little relief from the heat.\n\nA slightly cooler airmass may move into the area this weekend, however there is considerable uncertainty. A few areas towards eastern Ontario are likely to experience extreme heat and high humidex values on Saturday as well.\n\nPlease refer to your public forecast for further details on expected temperatures.\n\nHot and humid air can also bring deteriorating air quality and can result in the Air Quality Health Index approaching the high risk category.\n\n###\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
