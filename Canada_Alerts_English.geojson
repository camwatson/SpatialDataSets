Winds are expected to shift northwards late this afternoon and the squalls will gradually move out of the area.  Local snowfall amounts in the 10 to 15 cm range will be possible by tonight. \n\nVisibilities will likely be reduced at times in heavy snow and blowing snow, particularly over exposed areas.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Elevated pollution levels are expected or occurring.\n\nROAD DUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR VERNON (February 18, 2020 - Vernon) \n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Interior Health has issued a Road Dust Advisory for Vernon because of high concentrations of coarse particulate matter that are expected to persist until there is precipitation or dust suppression.  Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice. Persons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted.  Exposure is particularly a concern for infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease. \n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-02-20T00:15:48-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
