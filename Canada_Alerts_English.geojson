The combination of these winds and the fact that we are currently in a period of high amplitude tidal range could cause minor flooding along the coast near these localities, on the dates and at the times specified (Eastern Standard Time).\n\nQuebec City: 2020-12-17, from 06:30 p.m. to 09:30 p.m.\n\n###\n\nCoastal flooding is possible along the shoreline. Coastal erosion is possible in vulnerable areas.\n\nStorm surge warnings are issued when water levels pose a threat to coastal regions.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
