				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls are expected to develop. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nTotal snowfall: locally 10 to 15 cm in snow squalls.\n\nLocations: western Newfoundland from Port aux Basques to the Bay of Islands.\n\nTime span: tonight continuing through Thursday.\n\nRemarks: Flurries will continue overnight, with areas of snow squall activity developing as cold westerly winds continue.\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow squalls are expected to develop. Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nTotal snowfall: locally 10 to 15 cm in snow squalls.\n\nLocations: along the Burgeo Highway.\n\nTime span: overnight tonight through the day Thursday.\n\nRemarks: Flurries will continue overnight, with areas of snow squall activity developing as cold westerly winds strengthen. Snow squalls are expected to occur inland, mainly affecting the Burgeo Highway, with just a few flurries along the south coast.\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow with just a few kilometres are common.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Snow squalls and flurries will taper off from west to east through the day on Thursday.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
