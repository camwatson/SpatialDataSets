Some of these thunderstorms could reach severe thresholds.  The threat for severe thunderstorms will diminish late this evening.\n\nThis severe thunderstorm watch may be expanded eastwards later this afternoon or evening as the cold front continues to track eastwards across southern Manitoba.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
