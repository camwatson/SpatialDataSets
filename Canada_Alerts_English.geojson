Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nSnow squalls are expected to develop over southern sections of Great Slave Lake beginning this evening. The squalls are expected to persist over the region on Wednesday and into Thursday, with localized snowfall amounts possibly reaching or exceeding 25 cm by Thursday night.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
