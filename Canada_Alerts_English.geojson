				"Summary" : "Description: Significant Rainfall for Northeastern BC This Weekend.\n\nA series of disturbances moving through northern BC will continue to give  periods of moderate to heavy rainfall through Monday. Potential impacts for this event include rising rivers and destabilizing slopes.\n\nAn already moist air mass will be enhanced by upslope flow, particularly on the east slopes of the Northern Rockies. The communities of Liard River, Muncho Lake, Toad River, Nelson Forks, Sikanni Chief and their surrounding higher terrain may see up to 50 to 80 mm of total rainfall. These areas have experienced moderate rainfall events over the past few weeks thus the ground is quite saturated in some places.\n\nStay tuned to your local weather forecast and alerts: www.weather.gc.ca\n\nFlood Warnings and Advisories can be viewed at: http://bcrfc.env.gov.bc.ca/warnings/index.htm\n\nRoad Conditions: https://drivebc.ca/\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
