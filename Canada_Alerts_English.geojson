The lake effect snow bands will then weaken into a few flurries.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Heavy snow over the southern interior mountain passes beginning Thursday evening. \n\nAn approaching frontal system will track inland on Thursday and stall across the southern interior. The snow will begin in earnest Thursday evening with periods of snow persisting well into the coming weekend.\n\nFor Allison Pass, Coquihalla Summit, and Kootenay Pass, initial indications are for 15 to 25 cm of snow on Thursday night.\n\nRogers Pass, Coquihalla Highway - Helmer Lake, and the Okanagan Connector - Pennask Summit are expected to see 5 to 10 cm of snow Thursday night.\n\nStrong southwesterly winds aloft will introduce some warmer air to southwestern BC Thursday night, and it is possible that snow will become mixed with rain over Coquihalla Summit and Allison Pass.\n\nThe heaviest snow is expected to be Thursday night. However, periods of snow will continue into the weekend with additional accumulations likely.\n\nIn advance of what could be a busy period for holiday travel, please keep an eye on route forecasts and be prepared for winter road conditions.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
