Local blowing snow reducing visibilities to near zero will also be a concern. \n\nLocal snow squalls are expected to taper off when the winds shift to southwest Wednesday afternoon.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Lake Effect snow squalls continue today.\n\nFlurries and local snow squalls are expected to continue to affect the area this morning and early this afternoon before moving out of the region in the late afternoon.\n\nAdditional snowfall amounts of 10 to 20 cm are expected by late afternoon, with local blowing snow reducing visibilities to near zero at times. Travel is expected to be hazardous and squalls will have a significant impact on the morning commute. \n\nLocal snow squalls are expected to taper off when the wind shifts to the northwest this evening.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nSnow squall warnings are issued when bands of snow form that produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
