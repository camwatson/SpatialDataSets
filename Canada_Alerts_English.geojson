Current indications suggest that a swath from Pukaskwa National Park to Hearst is most likely to receive the heaviest snow and ice pellet amounts.  \n\nThe precipitation is forecast to change to freezing rain Friday morning and may last for several hours before changing to rain Friday afternoon.\n\nFreezing rain warnings may be required.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
