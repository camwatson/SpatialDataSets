Near zero visibilities at times are likely. The blizzard will continue through the night before easing Sunday morning as the skies clear and winds diminish.\n\nIn Rankin Inlet including Whale Cove, northerly winds gusting up to 70 km/h with a few cm of accumulating snow create blizzard conditions with visibilities near zero at times in falling and blowing snow beginning Saturday evening and last until Sunday early afternoon.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be extremely hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least 6 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Adverse Winter Driving Conditions Due to Heavy Snow This Weekend.\n\nAn unseasonably cool spring storm will deliver significant snow to the high mountain passes of southern B.C. Snow will continue today as the system pushes across British Columbia. In the wake of the system on Sunday, intense bursts of flurries will add further accumulations. Gusty winds will reduce visibilities in blowing snow, particularly on Sunday.\n\nSnow levels will be unseasonably low, hovering between 1100 and 1400 metres. A transition from rain at the lower elevations to heavy snow near the passes will make for adverse winter driving conditions.\n\nMotorists are encouraged to consider delaying travel plans until early next week when the snow will ease in the mountains. Drivers should be prepared for winter driving conditions and are reminded that winter tires are mandatory until April 30th.\n\nPlease check the highway forecasts before heading out and stay tuned for potential snowfall warnings.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
