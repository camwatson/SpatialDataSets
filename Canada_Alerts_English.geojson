				"Summary" : "Description: There is a slight possibility that Hurricane Dorian could bring near-hurricane conditions.\n\nHurricane Dorian will be leaving the coast of North Carolina and will begin to race northeastward toward the Maritimes today. The most likely track projection brings Hurricane Dorian south of the Maritimes on Saturday, pushing through eastern Nova Scotia Saturday night. Severe wind gusts reaching 150 km/h are possible over parts of the province beginning Saturday afternoon and evening.\n\nHeavy rain is expected with widespread amounts ranging from 50 to 100 mm. North of the hurricane amounts could exceed 150 mm increasing the potential for flooding.\n\nFlooding is also possible along the Atlantic coast due storm surge, the most likely period is from late afternoon through the evening.\n\n###\n\nA hurricane watch means that hurricane conditions are possible over parts of the region within 36 hours. Hurricane conditions include (A) sustained winds near 120 km/h or more, and/or (B) significantly elevated water levels and dangerous surf along the coast.\n\nBy nature, a hurricane also implies the threat of local flooding from heavy rainfall - consult your local area forecast for possible rainfall warnings.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. Reports of storm conditions and impacts can be emailed directly to NSstorm@canada.ca or by tweeting reports by province using #NSStorm, #NBStorm, #PEStorm, #NLwx, #QCStorm or #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-09-07T12:04:20-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-09-06T06:05:20-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3736137395.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County",

				"Summary" : "Description: For Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThe next information statement will be issued by 09:00 a.m. ADT.\n\nHurricane Dorian will begin to race towards Atlantic Canada later today - severe impacts across the region during the weekend. \n\n1. Summary of basic information at 03:00 a.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: 34.1 North 77.0 West.\n\nAbout: 185 kilometres southwest of Cape Hatteras.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 157 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: northeast at 25 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 958 millibars.\n\n\n2. Public weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nA Hurricane watch is in effect for all of Nova Scotia. \nTropical storm watches are in effect for southeastern New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, the Magdalen Islands and western Newfoundland.\n\nAccording to the latest forecast guidance, the most likely track projection brings Hurricane Dorian south of the Maritimes on Saturday, pushing through eastern Nova Scotia Saturday night, and then over the eastern Gulf of St. Lawrence waters or western Newfoundland by Sunday morning. \n\nSevere winds and torrential rain will have major impacts for southeastern New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Western Newfoundland, and the Quebec Lower North Shore. Large waves are expected for the Atlantic coasts of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and for eastern portions of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Finally, storm surge, combined with large waves and pounding surf, may give flooding for parts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, and the Magdalen Islands.\n\na. Wind.\n\nMost regions will experience tropical storm force winds of 90 to 110 km/h, beginning over southwestern Nova Scotia Saturday morning, in the afternoon over eastern Nova Scotia, and towards evening for Prince Edward Island, the Magdalen Islands, and southwestern Newfoundland. Near and to the south of the forecast track, winds will reach hurricane force of 120 km/h or more. Behind the storm, there is a possibility of hurricane force northwesterly gusts. Wind impacts will likely be enhanced by foliage on the trees, causing broken branches and tree falls, resulting in power outages, blocking of roads, and other type of damages. \n\nb. Rainfall.\n\nRainfall will be a major factor as torrential rain may lead to flooding. The highest rainfall amounts are expected over Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and the Magdalen Island where 50 to 100 mm are expected. Forecast guidance is also suggesting a swath in excess of 150 mm north and west of Dorian's track. Some districts have received large quantities of rain last week, and with the soil moisture still very high, excessive runoff may exacerbate the flooding potential. This combined with the severe winds may result in damage due to falling trees.    \n\nc. Surge/Waves.\n\nThere will also be some rough and pounding surf, especially for parts of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Large waves will reach the Southwestern Shore of Nova Scotia on Saturday and build to near 10 metres over the Eastern Shore Saturday night. These waves will likely reach southern Newfoundland by Sunday morning. Waves near or higher than 5 metres will impact north facing coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Note that waves will break higher along some of the coastlines, and dangerous rip currents are likely. Please exercise extreme caution. \n\nStorm surge is possible, mainly for the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, the north coast of Prince Edward Island, southwestern Newfoundland, and the Magdalen Islands. Current guidance suggests water levels approaching inundation levels during high tide. However, when combined with rough and pounding surf, there may be flooding and overwash of waves. Warnings may be issued later today.\n\n3. Marine weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nHurricane force wind warnings are in effect for southern and eastern waters of the Maritimes.\n\nAs Dorian moves into our waters, it will spread hurricane force southeasterlies near and south of its track, over offshore Canadian waters. As the hurricane moves further into the Maritimes, storm to hurricane force northwesterlies will develop behind it. Waves of 10 to 15 metres are expected south of the storm track, beginning late Saturday over southwestern waters and approaching the south coast of Newfoundland Sunday morning. As the low continues east Sunday into Monday, waves of 4 to 7 metres will develop over Funk and Belle Isle Banks and the South Labrador coast, with 3 to 5 metres expected over the Grand Banks.\n\nForecasters: Couturier\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-09-07T11:57:26-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-09-06T05:58:26-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2553564921.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Fredericton and Southern York County, Oromocto and Sunbury County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Stanley - Doaktown - Blackville Area, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Kouchibouguac National Park, Fundy National Park, Miramichi and area, Acadian Peninsula, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I., Avalon Peninsula North, Avalon Peninsula Southeast, St. John's and vicinity, Avalon Peninsula Southwest, Burin Peninsula, Connaigre, Burgeo - Ramea, Channel-Port aux Basques and vicinity, Corner Brook and vicinity, Deer Lake - Humber Valley, Gros Morne, Bay St. George, Buchans and the interior, Grand Falls-Windsor and vicinity, Bay of Exploits, Bonavista North, Bonavista Peninsula, Clarenville and vicinity, Gander and vicinity, Green Bay - White Bay, Terra Nova, Northern Peninsula East, Parson's Pond - Hawke's Bay, Port Saunders and the Straits, Red Bay to L'Anse-au-Clair, Norman Bay to Lodge Bay, Cartwright to Black Tickle, Eagle River, Chevery, Blanc-Sablon, Anticosti, Îles-de-la-Madeleine",
