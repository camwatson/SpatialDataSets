Some areas may see snowfall amounts in excess of 40 cm by Friday morning. \n\nVery strong northwest to west winds gusting to 70 km/h will combine with the snow to generate near zero visibility at times. \n\nWhile the snow squalls will shift slowly with time, this snow squall event is expected to last until Saturday morning.\n\nTravel will become nearly impossible at times.
