Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-06-03T19:43:19-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-06-03T03:44:19-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1240415435.2019<br>Area: Lac La Biche Co. near Plamondon Hylo and Avenir, Lac La Biche Co. near Heart Lake, Lac La Biche Co. near Lac La Biche and Square Lake, Lac La Biche Co. near Lakeland Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Elevated pollution levels are expected or occurring.\n\nHigh levels of air pollution are possible due to smoke from forest fires. \n\nSmoke plumes from a forest fire east of Pikangikum have resulted in deteriorated air quality in the area. Light and variable winds are expected to become southeasterly by Monday morning which may bring the smoke back into the Pikangikum and Sandy Lake areas.   \n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nIf you, or someone in your care, develop symptoms, reduce or reschedule strenuous outdoors activities where ever possible until the air quality improves.\n\n###\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-06-03T19:28:05-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-06-03T03:29:05-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1216886403.2019<br>Area: Sandy Lake - Weagamow Lake - Deer Lake, Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell",
