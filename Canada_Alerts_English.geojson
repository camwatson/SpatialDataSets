However, there is a risk of locally higher wind gusts this afternoon.\n\nThe cold arctic air combined with strong winds will lead to cold wind chill values today and tonight. \n\nIn the wake of the front, the arctic air over the interior will deepen and temperatures will continue to drop Thursday and Friday. \n \nPeople working and spending time outside are reminded to dress warmly and in layers, preferably with a wind-resistant outer layer.  Travellers are encouraged to add winter emergency kits to their vehicles which include a blanket, extra clothes and boots.\n \nFor more cold weather preparedness tips, visit: https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/seasonal-weather-hazards/be-prepared-for-winter.html#toc5\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

On Friday night, a new low pressure system will approach from the south and cause the precipitation to intensify.  Generally snow is expected inland while coastal areas of southeastern Labrador may see some mixing with rain. It is too soon to accurately predict snowfall totals.  However, at this time, it is not likely areas along the Strait will see any major accumulations.\n\nWind -\n\nPossible wind gusts: 90 to 120 km/h.\n\nTime span: Saturday morning to Sunday morning.\n\nRemarks: Winds will strengthen out of the northeast on Friday night and potentially reach warning criteria by early Saturday. Strong wind gusts will continue and gradually shift to northwesterly by Saturday night.  Coastal areas will have the greatest chance of seeing the strongest wind gusts.

Temperatures will dip below the freezing mark for most coastal communities. Blustery outflow winds will accompany the arrival of the arctic air yielding cold wind chill values. The arctic air will deepen throughout the rest of the week supporting temperatures and wind chill values down to the -5 to -10 range.\n\nPeople working and spending time outside are reminded to dress warmly and in layers, preferably with a wind-resistant outer layer. Travellers are encouraged to add winter emergency kits to their vehicles which include a blanket, extra clothes and boots.\n\nFor more cold weather preparedness tips, visit: https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/seasonal-weather-hazards/be-prepared-for-winter.html#toc5\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
