To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.\n\nFor more information: http://www.emergencymanagementontario.ca/english/beprepared/beprepared.html.<br>Expires: 2019-06-30T04:59:35-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-06-29T22:29:35-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1631367012.2019<br>Area: North Bay - Powassan - Mattawa",

				"Summary" : "Description: At 7:03 p.m. CDT, Environment Canada meteorologists are tracking an area of dangerous thunderstorms capable of producing damaging wind gusts, up to toonie size hail and heavy rain.\n\nAn area of severe thunderstorms is moving through western Manitoba. These severe thunderstorms have produced nickel to golfball sized hail and locally heavy downpours. These thunderstorms will persist into the evening and continue to track eastward. Strong gusty winds and large hail are likely this evening.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.<br>Expires: 2019-06-30T02:22:14-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-06-30T00:04:14-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3278343110.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Grahamdale incl.

Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.
