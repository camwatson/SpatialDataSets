Lesser amounts elsewhere.\n\nMaximum wind gusts: easterly 80 km/h.\n\nTime span: tonight into Sunday night.\n\nRemarks: Snow will develop this evening over southeastern Labrador and spread to central and the remainder of coast through the night.  The snow will change through ice pellets and freezing rain to rain on Sunday. Central and inland areas of coastal Labrador could see several hours of freezing rain during the changeover.  The rainfall, combined with temperatures above zero late in the day on Sunday could result in significant snowmelt in some areas, especially coastal areas south of Groswater Bay.     \n \nAnyone planning weather sensitive activities is advised to plan ahead. Travel is expected to become difficult as a result of these conditions.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise until the advisory is lifted. Staying indoors and in air conditioned spaces helps to reduce fine particulate exposure. Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease. \n\nFor the duration of this advisory the use of woodstoves is prohibited within the Districtof Houston, unless the woodstove is the only source of heat in a dwelling. \n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-12-15T04:50:47-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
