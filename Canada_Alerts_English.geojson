Along parts of the Atlantic coast, especially in the southwest, rain is expected. Over these areas, snowfall amounts will be much lower than inland areas. Northern and eastern areas of the province could see 20 cm of snow with locally higher amounts approaching 30 cm by the storm's end overnight Saturday night. Additionally, strong east to northeast winds gusting to 60 to 80 km/h may significantly reduce visibility in blowing snow.\n\nSnowfall warnings have been issued for Annapolis, Kings, Hants and parts of Cumberland and Colchester counties. Additional warnings will likely be issued for parts of eastern Nova Scotia later today as this system continues to draw nearer.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Snow or ice pellets are forecast to transition to freezing rain by early this evening.  Freezing rain may be mixed with ice pellets or rain at times.  \n\nThis period of freezing rain could bring measurable ice accretion up to 5 mm over some areas.  The freezing rain should transition to rain late this evening before finally transitioning back to snow overnight.\n\nThis precipitation is associated with a low pressure system moving north from Texas which will track near the south shore of Lake Erie tonight.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Ice build-up may cause tree branches to break. Utility outages may occur.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
