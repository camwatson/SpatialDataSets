				"Summary" : "Description: Significant ice build-up due to a long-lasting period of freezing rain is expected or occurring.\n\nA significant freezing rain event will develop over southern portions of the Brochet and Tadoule Lake regions tonight, then spread northwards and eastwards through the day on Monday.\n\nThe freezing rain at any one location could last from as little as 6 hours to as much as 24 hours. Total freezing rain accumulations could reach as high as 20 to 25 mm in some locations.\n\nIn Churchill, the freezing rain will likely begin early Monday morning and persist through the day. Although temperatures will climb towards freezing, a persistent northeasterly wind off of Hudson Bay will likely keep precipitation as freezing rain through the day. The precipitation will ease through Monday night with temperatures gradually climbing above 0C by Tuesday morning.\n\nFreezing rain accumulations in Churchill could reach as high as 10 to 15 mm.\n\nFurther west, the event will begin earlier, and has the potential to be more intense. The hardest hit area by this system will be over southern areas of the Tadoule Lake region, where the freezing rain will begin on Sunday night and persist for nearly 24 hours before tapering off on Tuesday evening. Freezing rain accumulations will likely reach 15 to 25 mm across the region. In the Tadoule Lake townsite, the event will occur mainly on Monday night into Tuesday morning with 5 to 10 mm accumulation.\n\nBrochet will experience the least severe event, limited by milder temperatures and lighter precipitation. Freezing rain will develop over the southeastern corner of the region on Sunday night and push northwards  Monday into Tuesday with likely accumulations of 2 to 5 mm.\n\nThe location and intensity of freezing rain will be very sensitive to the exact track of this system as well as small changes in temperature. This warning may be updated as the system develops with changes to expected locations and/or amounts.\n\n###\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
