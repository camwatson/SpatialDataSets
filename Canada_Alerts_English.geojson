Although amounts may not be enough to require a warning, travel is still expected to be hazardous in these areas.  Please consider postponing non-essential travel.\n\nWith respect to the second system for Thursday and Friday: At this time the weather looks very similar to the first system.  Significant snowfall is likely over parts of the island, with an area of ice pellets or freezing rain, as well as rain along the south coast.\n\nFurther details will be provided on this next system in subsequent forecasts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
