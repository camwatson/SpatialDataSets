Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nLake Winnipeg North Basin snow squall activity strengthened during the night as cold northwest winds blew over the relatively warm waters of the lake. These squalls are occurring southeastward off the lake, primarily into the Berens River and Bloodvein areas. \n\nThe snow squalls will persist through today and into Monday before tapering off. Snowfall accumulations will be highly variable across short distances, but accumulations of 15 cm in 12 hours will be possible and some areas may see event total snowfalls as high as 25 to 30 cm by the time it tapers off on Monday.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Rapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nSnow squall warnings are issued when bands of snow form that produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
