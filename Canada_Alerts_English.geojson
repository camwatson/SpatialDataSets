Some of these flurries are then expected to intensify into local snow squalls and continue into the morning. \n\nAreas south and east of Elliot Lake are most likely to see the snow squalls. Local snowfall accumulations of 10 to 20 cm will be possible by the time the snow squalls move east of the region in the morning.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
