The ground, already near saturation, has little ability to absorb further rainfall.\n\nA low pressure system over northern Alberta will continue to give rain at times heavy to the Fort Nelson and Muncho Lake - Stone Mountain Park regions today and tonight. \n\nSince Sunday morning, 25 to 50 mm of rain has fallen across the region from this storm. An additional 25 to 40 mm is forecast for today and tonight.\n\nRain showers will continue on Tuesday.  \n\nGiven the wet antecedent conditions in the region this past month (including a similar weather system last weekend), the ground is already saturated in many areas. The prolonged moderate to heavy rainfall may result in higher overland runoff. \n\nFlood warnings and advisories from the BC River Forecast Centre can be found at: http://bcrfc.env.gov.bc.ca/warnings/index.htm .\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The ground, already near saturation, has little ability to absorb further rainfall.\n\nA low pressure system over northern Alberta will continue to give rain at times heavy to the northern BC Peace region today.\n\nCommunities in the north Peace have recorded from 30 to 80 mm so far from this storm; the highest amounts have been observed near the Rockies over communities like Hudson Hope. \n\nA further 15 to 20 mm is forecast today and tonight before the rain ends. \n\nGiven the wet antecedent conditions in the region this past month (including a similar weather system last weekend), the ground is already saturated in many areas. The prolonged moderate to heavy rainfall may result in higher overland runoff. \n\nFlood warnings and advisories from the BC River Forecast Centre can be found at: http://bcrfc.env.gov.bc.ca/warnings/index.htm .\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
