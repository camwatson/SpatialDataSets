				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nSnow at times heavy continues today in southern Alberta. Total snowfall accumulations will range between 20 to 40 cm, with locally higher amounts over higher terrain in the Crowsnest Pass region and near the Cypress Hills.\n\nAdditionally, strong northerly winds with gusts as high as 60-80 km/h will persist and produce widespread blowing snow with sudden whiteout conditions today for regions south of Red Deer and near and east of Highway 2. The strong winds are expected to diminish this afternoon. Heavy snow will continue tonight and taper off by Monday morning.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total amounts of 10 to 20 cm continues.\n\nModerate to heavy snow continues today over western and central Saskatchewan. \n\nA second potent winter storm will move into Saskatchewan today. This next system will spread an additional 10 to 20 cm of snow into The Battlefords northeastwards to Prince Albert by Monday morning.\n\nAccumulations from this second wave of snow will diminish rapidly towards the northwest.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA potent winter storm will bring heavy snow, wind, and a risk of freezing rain on Sunday.\n\nA powerful low pressure system will impact the Prairies today. Moderate to heavy snow will begin this morning  and continue through to Monday. Snowfall totals as high as 30 to 50 cm are expected. Moderate northerly winds will develop and produce periods of reduced visibility in blowing snow today into Sunday night. Some regions will also see a mix of snow and freezing rain; consult local forecasts for more details on the location and timing.\n\nConditions will remain extremely poor Sunday night before the system departs on Monday.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Ice build-up may cause tree branches to break.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
