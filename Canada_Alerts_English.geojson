				"Summary" : "Description: A wet and windy weekend for Coastal BC\n\nHeavy rain and strong winds are in store for coastal communities of BC this weekend. An atmospheric river will take aim at northern Vancouver Island and the Central Coast beginning early Saturday morning delivering heavy rain and mild conditions until mid-day Sunday. The heaviest rainfall is expected along the west side of Vancouver Island and coastal communities of the Central Coast. The details remain to be finalized however; total rainfall amounts in excess of 100 mm are likely over these areas.\n\nGiven the tropical origin of the atmospheric river, freezing levels will be on the rise upwards of 3000 metres for the South Coast and close to 2500 metres for the North Coast. The mild air will result in rain at almost all elevations. High runoff and rising river levels are likely through the weekend. \n\nMountainous regions further south including the Sunshine Coast, Howe Sound and the North Shore Mountains will also see significant rainfall, potentially exceeding the rainfall warning criteria of 50 mm in 24 hours. \n\nIn addition to the heavy rain, strong winds will also accompany the moisture-laden system. Exposed coastal communities along West Vancouver Island, the Central and North Coasts will likely experience wind gusts in excess of 90km/h on Saturday morning.\n\nThe public is encouraged to monitor potential rainfall and wind warnings from Environment and Climate Change Canada as well as potential high streamflow advisories or flood watches from the BC River Forecast Centre.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-11-15T13:18:46-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-11-14T21:19:46-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2486680001.2019<br>Area: North Vancouver Island, West Vancouver Island, Central Coast - coastal sections, Sunshine Coast - Gibsons to Earls Cove, Sunshine Coast - Saltery Bay to Powell River, Howe Sound, Metro Vancouver - North Shore including West Vancouver and North Vancouver, Metro Vancouver - northeast including Coquitlam and Maple Ridge",
