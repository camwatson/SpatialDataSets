These thunderstorms will have the potential to produce very strong wind gusts.  The thunderstorm threat will diminish early this evening.  This severe thunderstorm watch may be expanded southwards as thunderstorm development is monitored this afternoon.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
