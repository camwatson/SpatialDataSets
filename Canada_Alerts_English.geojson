				"Summary" : "Description: Potential snow for the BC South Coast Thursday night to Friday morning\n\nWith the shift into cooler weather, snow is looking likely over the BC South Coast this week. \n\nWhile there may be a few light flurries mixed with rain tonight, the first real opportunity for widespread low elevation snow is shaping up to be Thursday night.\n\nA low tracking south along the BC coast will spread moisture across the BC South Coast beginning Thursday evening. With temperatures hovering near the freezing mark, a mix of rain or snow is forecast across the region. \n\nAs is frequently the case, snowfall amounts will vary across the region with  elevation and proximity to the ocean. The latest computer guidance suggests that the Fraser Valley, Howe Sound, and higher elevations of Metro Vancouver and Vancouver Island have the potential for snowfall accumulations to exceed 5 cm Thursday night through Friday morning. The snow is expected to change to rain near mid-day Friday. \n\nMore snow is possible this weekend as a series of weather systems embedded in a cool northwest flow from the Gulf of Alaska moves ashore. \n\nEarly next week, very cold arctic air from the BC Interior will arrive on the South Coast.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-01-09T17:35:24-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-01-09T01:36:24-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1629742582.2020<br>Area: East Vancouver Island - Duncan to Nanaimo, East Vancouver Island - Nanoose Bay to Fanny Bay, East Vancouver Island - Courtenay to Campbell River, Inland Vancouver Island, Sunshine Coast - Gibsons to Earls Cove, Sunshine Coast - Saltery Bay to Powell River, Howe Sound, Metro Vancouver - North Shore including West Vancouver and North Vancouver, Metro Vancouver - central including the City of Vancouver Burnaby and New Westminster, Metro Vancouver - northeast including Coquitlam and Maple Ridge, Metro Vancouver - southeast including Surrey and Langley, Metro Vancouver - southwest including Richmond and Delta, Fraser Valley - west including Abbotsford, Fraser Valley - central including Chilliwack, Fraser Valley - east including Hope",

Snowfall totals in the area are expected to be in the 10 to 15 cm range. Snow will taper off over western areas overnight and eastern areas Thursday morning. \n\nIn addition to the snow, strong southeasterly winds gusting to 60 km/h will create reduced visibilities in blowing snow.
