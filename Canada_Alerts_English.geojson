				"Summary" : "Description: ROAD DUST ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR BURNS LAKE AND SMITHERS\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Northern Health has continued a Road Dust Advisory for Burns Lake and Smithers because of high concentrations of coarse particulate matter that are expected to persist until there is precipitation or dust suppression.  Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted.  Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at  https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-03-18T20:11:35-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snow and blowing snow expected Thursday evening into Friday.\n\nAn approaching low pressure system will track over Lake Huron late Thursday bringing snow to Northern Ontario. Snow will begin over the area overnight and become heavier on Thursday. Snow will gradually weaken Friday afternoon. \n\nTotal snowfall amounts of 15 to 25 cm are expected.\n\nAdditionally, northerly winds gusting 50 or 60 km/h are expected Friday resulting in blowing snow.\n\nThere remains some uncertainty in the exact track of this low and the northern extent of the highest snowfall amounts. Winter Storm Warnings may be required as the situation becomes more clear.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
