This system will pump frequent periods of heavy rain into the province beginning this evening and continuing on Tuesday before easing off Wednesday morning or early afternoon.\n\nAt this time, rainfall amounts are expected to be heaviest in the southwestern portion of the province where rainfall amounts of 80 to 130 mm are possible by late Tuesday with additional amounts expected on Tuesday night and into Wednesday, potentially giving total  rainfall in excess of 150 mm in some areas before ending on Wednesday.\n\nSimilar rainfall events in the past have caused road washouts and localized flooding in low-lying areas.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Localized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
