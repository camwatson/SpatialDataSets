				"Summary" : "Description: An intense low pressure system tracking northeast over Hudson Strait is giving strong north winds and blowing snow to Coral Harbour. \n\nNorth to northwest winds as high as 60 gusting 80 km/h are likely causing pockets of significantly reduced visibility in blowing snow. However, no reports of blizzard conditions have come out of Coral Harbour, yet. The winter storm watch remains in effect as there is the possibility that some areas are experiencing visibilities of 400 metres or less in blowing snow. Winds will begin to diminish overnight, and the blizzard potential will cease and the winter storm watch will be ended.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
