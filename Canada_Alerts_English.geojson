These snow squalls will continue through the night before weakening early Monday morning.  \n\nLocal snowfall accumulations up to 15 cm will be possible by the time the snow squalls come to an end.\n\nUnder these snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced at times due to heavy snow combined with blowing snow.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
