				"Summary" : "Description: Major winter storm to impact southern Saskatchewan this weekend.\n\nA powerful low pressure system will bring an abrupt return to winter this weekend. Today, an early disturbance has begun affecting west-central and central Saskatchewan, with 10 to 15 cm of snow expected for the day along with a risk of freezing rain. Snowfall warnings have been issued for impacted regions.\n\nOn Sunday, the main system arrives, bringing more intense and widespread severe winter weather to the southern half of the province. Heaviest snow is expected to accumulate on a line from the southwestern corner of the province to Hudson Bay, Saskatchewan; these areas could see 30 to 50 cm of snow by Monday afternoon. In the southwest, the snowfall will be accompanied by northerly winds gusting to 70 km/h. Blizzard conditions are likely and may continue into Sunday night. Elsewhere, widespread blowing snow is possible in areas that receive heavy snow as winds intensify Sunday afternoon through to Monday morning.\n\nSunday morning, freezing rain is likely along a line from Regina east and north to Yorkton and to the Manitoba border. The freezing rain will intensify Sunday afternoon and evening for these areas before switching to snow early Monday morning. Total freezing rain accumulations of 5 to 15 mm are possible.\n\nDetails in timing and intensity are likely to shift somewhat as the event approaches. Please stay alert for further bulletins and check your public forecast for additional details.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Major winter storm to impact central and northern Manitoba Sunday into Monday.\n\nA powerful low pressure system will bring significant snow and freezing rain to central and northern Manitoba beginning Sunday afternoon. The heaviest snowfall is expected on a line from The Pas northeast to Shamattawa; these areas could see 30 to 50 cm of fresh snow by Monday evening. Gusty northeasterly winds accompanying the snow may result in reduced visibilities at times.\n\nFrom the Manitoba Parklands northeast to Island Lake, precipitation will begin as ice pellets or freezing rain, lasting into Sunday night or early Monday before transitioning to snow. Total freezing precipitation accumulations of 5 to 15 mm are possible followed by 10 to 20 cm of snow. The system will depart the area Monday evening.\n\nDetails in timing and intensity are likely to shift somewhat as the event approaches. Please stay alert for further bulletins and check your public forecast for additional details.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-11-08T02:39:17-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-11-07T10:40:17-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3065882223.2020<br>Area: Grand Rapids and Easterville, Waterhen Meadow Portage and Skownan, Mun. of Roblin incl.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nAn intense winter storm developing in the American Northwest will spread 20 to 30 cm of heavy snow across southern Alberta beginning today and ending Monday.\n\nThe snow will spread northeastwards from Pincher Creek to Medicine Hat today, with the heaviest snow expected overnight into Sunday. Additionally, strong northerly winds with gusts to 70 km/h are expected to produce widespread blowing snow with sudden whiteout conditions starting this afternoon and lasting into Sunday. By Sunday afternoon winds will diminish and the heavy snow will taper off by Monday morning.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts of 30 to 40 cm are possible with locally higher amounts over higher terrain in the Crowsnest Pass region and near the Cypress Hills.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Snow, very heavy at times, will begin late in the evening and continue through to Monday morning. Total amounts of 30 to 50 cm are expected. The onset of strong northerly winds tonight along with the heavy snow will result in blizzard conditions developing by Sunday morning. Conditions will remain extremely poor throughout the day and into Sunday night before the system finally moves off Monday morning.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility. Rapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least 4 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
