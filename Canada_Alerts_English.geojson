Strong to high winds combined with snow will greatly reduce visibilities in blowing snow over the most exposed areas.\n\nThe Quebec City area poses a challenge as localities north of the St. Lawrence may receive significant amounts of snow and ice pellets while also being affected by a more or less extended period of freezing rain. Areas south of the St. Lawrence River could be affected by some snow, freezing rain and even rain.\n\nAs the exact track of the low remains uncertain, the type and amount of precipitation received could be significantly affected.\n\nConsider modifying any non-essential travel plans.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
