				"Summary" : "Description: For Post-tropical Storm Erin.\n\nThis is a special meteorological summary for Post-tropical Erin. \n\nThis is the final information statement for this storm.\n\n1. Full discussion of the event:\n\nOn Monday, August 26th, the circulation around an area of low pressure halfway between Bermuda and Carolina coast became better defined. At the time, the convection southeast of the centre was persistent and the initial wind speed was set at 55 km/h. The depression remained poorly organized during the day. \n\nSlight strengthening was expected during the Tuesday to Wednesday period due to diminishing deep layer wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures and an approaching baroclinic trough. On Tuesday the 27th, satellite imagery showed that despite the presence of several swirls rotating around a centre, the circulation had remained poorly defined. The cloud pattern continued to improve during the day, and by the end of it, the convection had developed near the centre of the circulation. Based on subjective satellite analysis the intensity estimate was increased to 65 km/h, or tropical storm intensity. \n\nHowever by the morning of Wednesday, August 28th, the system became less organized and the intensity estimate was lowered to 55 km/h. At that time, global models indicated that the interaction between an approaching trough and Erin or its remnants could deepen the system as a post-tropical low on Thursday. Satellite imagery showed the merging of post-tropical low Erin and an approaching baroclinic trough during the early morning of Thursday, August 29th. \n\nPost-tropical depression Erin reached the South shore of Nova Scotia Thursday evening, passing east of Shelburne with a central pressure near 1005 millibars. It then travelled northeastward past St Margarets Bay and Halifax in the early hours of Friday, August 30th. It was accompanied by southerly winds gusting between 50 to 75 km/h. The weakening system then reached the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence in the morning. It was established earlier in the week that the main impact to be expected from this transitioning storm was going to be rainfall. Rain bands reached the Maritimes during the day Thursday, and several rounds of heavy rain affected parts of southern New Brunswick, western and northern Nova Scotia and western Prince Edward Island. At the peak of the rainfall, several surface stations reported rainfall rates in excess of 30 millimetres per hour which gave increased surface runoff and flooding. As an example, the last round of rain brought 66 millimetres at Baccaro Point in less than two hours. \n          \n2. Summary of rainfall amounts in millimetres:\n\nParrsboro: 162\nPort Maitland: 155\nScots Bay: 152\nGreenwood: 127\nNappan:  121\nKentville: 115\nBaccaro Point: 99\nYarmouth: 79\nSummerside: 67\nFredericton: 56\nMechanic Settlement: 54\nHalifax Stanfield Airport: 53\nNew Ross: 53\nMoncton: 50\nHalifax Windsor Park: 48\n\n3. Summary of peak winds in kilometres per hour:\n\nBeaver Island: 76\nLunenburg: 72\nHalifax Stanfield Airport: 69\nOsborne Head: 67\n\nForecaster: Couturier.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-08-30T22:59:52-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-08-30T09:12:52-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3313504849.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Fredericton and Southern York County, Oromocto and Sunbury County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Kouchibouguac National Park, Fundy National Park, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I.",
