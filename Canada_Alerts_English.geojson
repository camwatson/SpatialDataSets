Blizzard or near blizzard conditions are likely with significantly reduced visibilities. \n\nOver the Kivalliq, conditions will deteriorate Thursday morning with improvement forecast by Friday morning. Over the Melville Peninsula, conditions will begin to deteriorate Thursday afternoon and improve Friday overnight. \n\nPlease stay alert for updated bulletins as this winter storm watch may be upgraded to a blizzard warning for some communities as the event nears. And please refer to your local forecast for additional information on wind speeds and timing.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nWinter storm watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
