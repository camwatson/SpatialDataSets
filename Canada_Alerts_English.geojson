Moderate to heavy rain redeveloped over southwestern Manitoba Saturday afternoon and is expected to gradually move to the northeast tonight. \n\nEarly this evening satellite and weather radar indicated that the heavier precipitation associated with this system is taking a more northerly track. As a result portions of the northern Red River valley and the Bissett area will likely see lesser rainfall amounts and the rainfall warning has been ended for these regions. The rainfall warning remains in effect for portions of southwestern Manitoba and the southern Interlake with the rain tapering off this evening and overnight respectively. Total rainfall amounts in these areas from Thursday night to Sunday morning will likely range from 50 to 125 mm.  \n\n\n.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.
