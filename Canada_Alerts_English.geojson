Rainfall warnings have been issued for the Atlantic coast, parts of central Nova Scotia, and northern Nova Scotia. It is possible that these may be extended to other parts of eastern Nova Scotia as the system approaches, should the forecast track or intensity of the system change.\n\nRain will change to flurries over western Nova Scotia late Tuesday night as cold westerly winds move into the region and temperatures quickly fall below freezing.  Driving conditions may become icy overnight or Wednesday morning as the cold air and flurries push eastward across the province.\n\nThe travelling public are urged to prepare for potentially difficult driving conditions tonight and Tuesday morning in areas of northern mainland Nova Scotia and northwestern Cape Breton receiving snow.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
