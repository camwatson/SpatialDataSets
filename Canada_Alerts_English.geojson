Squalls of 40 knots are likely, with higher gusts of 50 knots possible. \n\nFrequent lightning and 2 cm hail are also possible.\n\n###\n\nPoor to very poor visibility may contribute to voyage delays and make marine navigation hazardous. Large hail can damage vessels and cause injury.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
