Afternoon temperatures are expected to be in the low thirties both days. Minimum temperatures in the low twenties tonight will provide little relief from the heat. \n\nHumidex values in the upper thirties to near 40 are likely for both days.\n\nA cold front sliding down from the north will bring this heat event to an end Wednesday night.\n\n###\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
