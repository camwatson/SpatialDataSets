				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total amounts of 5 to 20 cm is expected today and tonight.\n \nA favourable set up for widespread low elevation snow over the south coast is shaping up for today and tonight. A front will track down the BC coast beginning this morning and combine with a cool airmass to produce snow across the lowlands.  \n\nSnowfall amounts will vary significantly across the region. The air will be cool, but not truly Arctic, so snowfall amounts will vary with proximity to the water, elevation and intensity of precipitation. \n\nAnywhere from 5 to 20 cm of heavy, wet snow is expected. The highest amounts are expected over the northern and inland sections of Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley where the snow will persist the longest, until tonight or Wednesday morning. \n\nWarmer air will arrive faster over Sunshine Coast, East Vancouver Island, and the southwestern sections of Metro Vancouver and the transition to rain there will start this afternoon or evening. \n\nPrecipitation should be rain everywhere across the south coast lowlands by Wednesday as a flow of milder Pacific air returns.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. There may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

A front will track down the BC coast beginning this morning and combine with a cool airmass to produce snow across the south coast lowlands.\n\nSnowfall amounts will vary significantly across Vancouver Island. The air will be cool, but not truly Arctic, so snowfall amounts will vary with proximity to the water, elevation and intensity of precipitation. \n\nOver Inland Vancouver Island, 5 to 10 cm of heavy, wet snow is expected by this afternoon. Over higher elevations of the inland highways 10 cm of snow is possible.  Warmer air will arrive this afternoon and the snow should transition to rain throughout the region.  \n\nHowe Sound will see 10 to 15 cm of total accumulation by tonight. \n\nPrecipitation should be rain everywhere across the south coast lowlands by  Wednesday as a flow of milder Pacific air returns.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total amounts of 10 to 20 cm is expected.\n\nSignificant Snow on Tuesday.\n \nA favourable set up for widespread low elevation snow over the south coast is shaping up for Tuesday and Tuesday night. A front will track down the BC coast beginning Tuesday morning and combine with a cool airmass to produce snow across the lowlands.  \n\nSnowfall amounts will vary significantly across the region. The air will be cool, but not truly Arctic, so snowfall amounts will vary with proximity to the water, elevation and intensity of precipitation. \n\nAnywhere from 5 to 20 cm of heavy, wet snow is expected. The highest amounts are expected over the northern and inland sections of Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley where the snow will persist the longest, until Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. Warmer air will arrive faster over Sunshine Coast and the southwestern sections of Metro Vancouver and the transition to rain there will start Tuesday afternoon or evening. \n\nPrecipitation should be rain everywhere across the south coast lowlands by Wednesday as a flow of milder Pacific air returns.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. There may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
