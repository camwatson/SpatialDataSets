Lowering freezing levels and unsettled conditions will support the chance of snow over higher elevations.\n\nKootenay Pass has the potential to see a significant amount of snow during this period. Rain will likely give way to periods of snow near the summit on Friday night and could persist well into Sunday. At this time, amounts remain quite uncertain, but snowfall accumulations of 5 to 15 cm are possible by Saturday night.\n\nLesser elevation passes, including Rogers Pass, the Coquihalla Highway - Merritt to Kamloops and the Okanagan Connector, should see snow near the summits beginning Friday with light accumulations possible through the weekend.\n\nAreas along the BC - Alberta border are expected to see snow as well. In the Elk Valley, freezing levels will hover just above the valley bottom on Friday and drop Friday evening. A changeover to snow is likely Friday night with periods of snow possibly persisting through Sunday. Again, accumulations remain uncertain at this time, but 5 to 10 cm by Saturday night is plausible.\n\nA return to drier conditions and seasonal temperatures are expected early next week.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Alberta's first significant snowfall of the season is expected Friday September 27 through Monday September 30 in the Mountain Parks and Foothills.\n\nSnow is forecast to begin falling in the mountain parks early Friday morning spreading south and eastwards throughout the day. How far east the snow spreads remains uncertain at this time, however the highest accumulations are expected to remain along the foothills and into the mountain parks. Calgary will likely see snowflakes by Friday evening, with accumulations up to 5 cm by Sunday morning.\n \nAs the system moves south, upslope flow will enhance snowfall in the extreme southwest corner of the province and into Montana. Warm surface temperatures will affect snowfall accumulations initially but at this time, daily snowfall totals look to be in the 5-10 cm range for most areas, with the Waterton region in the 15-20 cm range. By Monday, total accumulations of 20-30 cm over areas along the mountains and foothills are expected, with the possibility of seeing near 50 cm in localized areas of extreme southwestern Alberta as well as higher elevations in the mountain parks.\n\nPoor driving conditions throughout the weekend can be expected in southwestern Alberta, including Highway 1 west of Calgary and portions of the QEII.\n\nThis is expected to be a long duration event, with snow beginning Friday morning and tapering off by Monday. Temperatures are forecast to rebound into the low-mid teens by mid-week, making this brief brush with winter just that...brief.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Alberta's first significant snowfall of the season is expected Friday September 27 through Monday September 30 in the Mountain Parks and Foothills.\n\nSnow is forecast to begin falling in the mountain parks early Friday morning spreading south and eastwards throughout the day. How far east the snow spreads remains uncertain at this time, however the highest accumulations are expected to remain along the foothills and into the mountain parks. Calgary will likely see snowflakes by Friday evening, with accumulations up to 5 cm by Sunday morning.\n \nAs the system moves south, upslope flow will enhance snowfall in the extreme southwest corner of the province and into Montana. Warm surface temperatures will affect snowfall accumulations initially but at this time, daily snowfall totals look to be in the 5-10 cm range for most areas, with the Waterton region in the 15-20 cm range. By Monday, total accumulations of 20-30 cm over areas along the mountains and foothills are expected, with the possibility of seeing near 50 cm in localized areas of extreme southwestern Alberta as well as higher elevations in the mountain parks.\n\nPoor driving conditions throughout the weekend can be expected in southwestern Alberta, including Highway 1 west of Calgary and portions of the QEII.\n\nThis is expected to be a long duration event, with snow beginning Friday morning and tapering off by Monday. Temperatures are forecast to rebound into the low-mid teens by mid-week, making this brief brush with winter just that...brief.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
