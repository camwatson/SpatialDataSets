This is particularly true for higher elevations, especially the Swan Hills. 10-20cm of snowfall accumulation is possible near the Swan Hills by Monday afternoon.\n\nIn addition, winds with gusts up to 60 km/h will accompany this system.\n\nSome uncertainty still exists regarding the timing and location of the rain and snow, including the anticipated amounts mentioned above.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
