This boundary will slide southward tonight, and thus rain will change to periods of snow over the remainder of the province by early Friday morning. \n\nPeriods of snow will redevelop or persist mainly over eastern and southern parts of the province on Friday before easing off later in the day. Snowfall amounts across the province will range between 2 and 10 centimetres, with the highest amounts expected over eastern sections on Friday, where locally total amounts could reach near 15 centimetres over higher terrain.\n\nAs this will be the first significant snowfall across much of the province, the travelling public are urged to use caution and prepare for winter driving conditions.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
