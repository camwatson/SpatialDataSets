Local snowfall accumulations of 2 to 4 cm are possible near valley bottom while higher elevations and areas near Hope could see 10 cm or more. \n\nThe heavy precipitation will end this evening as the low moves to the east.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.

Heavy snow is expected to begin in the southwest Tuesday morning spreading quickly eastward throughout the day and continuing into Tuesday night. Current guidance indicates most the south will see 15 to 25 cm of fresh snow and locally higher amounts will be possible. \n\nIn addition, northerly winds gusting 60 to 70 km/h will develop through the day. Significant reductions to visibility in snow and blowing snow will occur at times and blizzard conditions are possible. \n\nThe snow and winds will both ease Wednesday morning as the system departs to the east.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations. Poor weather conditions may contribute to transportation delays.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: 15 to 25 cm of snow with blowing snow for Tuesday and Tuesday night.\n\nA strong low pressure system will track along the international border Tuesday bringing more snow and blowing snow to southern Manitoba. Heavy snow is expected to begin in the southwest Tuesday morning spreading quickly eastward throughout the day and continuing into Tuesday night. Current guidance indicates most the south will see 15 to 25 cm of fresh snow and locally higher amounts will be possible. \n\nIn addition, northerly winds gusting 60 to 70 km/h will develop through the day. Significant reductions to visibility in snow and blowing snow will occur at times and blizzard conditions are possible. \n\nThe snow and winds will both ease Wednesday morning as the system departs to the east.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations. Poor weather conditions may contribute to transportation delays.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Windchill values will moderate slightly Monday morning.\n\nIn addition to the extreme cold, the strong winds will also produce widespread blowing snow with near blizzard conditions. These conditions will persist throughout the night into Monday with gradual improvement expected for Tuesday. This situation may warrant a blizzard warning if visibilities become more restrictive over a longer duration. As a result, the public is advised to listen for possible upgraded warnings.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\n\nExtreme cold warnings are issued when very cold temperatures or wind chill creates an elevated risk to health such as frost bite and hypothermia.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Local snowfall accumulations of 5 cm are expected at lower elevations.\n\nThe snow will end by late this afternoon as the low moves to the east.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult.

Abundant moisture associated with the low will result in very heavy precipitation which will drag the freezing level down to near 200 metres by late morning. There is the potential for local snowfall accumulations of 5 cm near sea level while higher terrain could see amounts up to 15 cm. Rainfall amounts of up to 40 mm are also expected.\n\nThe heavy precipitation will end by early this evening as the low moves to the east.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. There may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total amounts of 10 to 20 cm is expected.\n\nA strong low pressure system will track along the international border tonight bringing heavy snow to much of southern Saskatchewan. Snow will begin in the southwest in the evening and spread eastward to the Manitoba border by Tuesday morning. A swath of up to 20 cm is expected through Tuesday evening generally centered along the Trans-Canada Highway corridor.\n \nIn addition, gusty northerly winds accompanying the snow will result in visibility reductions at times due to blowing snow. Towards the international border, milder temperatures may see some freezing rain and/or rain early before transitioning entirely to snow later on Tuesday. \n\nThe system will depart the province entirely late Tuesday evening.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. There may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total amounts of 15 to 25 cm is expected.\n\nA Pacific low moving eastward just south of Vancouver Island today will bring very heavy precipitation to southern Vancouver Island. Heavy rain will gradually switch to heavy wet snow at higher elevations as temperatures continue to cool. Snowfall accumulations will likely reach 20 cm over southern sections in a short period of time. Local snowfall accumulations of 5 cm are expected at lower elevations.\n\nThe snow will end by late this afternoon as the low moves to the east.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Snowfall with total amounts of 20 to 25 cm is expected.\n\nA deepening Pacific low will make its way across Washington state during the day then will cross the southeast corner of B.C. tonight. Abundant moisture associated with the system combined with cold air to the north of its trajectory will produce heavy snowfall across the southern interior of British Columbia. \n\nSnow will begin over the West Columbia region Monday morning then intensify in the afternoon and evening before tapering off overnight. \n\nTotal snowfall accumulation of 20 to 25 cm is expected for this event with the highest amounts likely near Rogers Pass and more generally over higher terrain.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
