Some of these thunderstorms may reach severe thresholds.  The cluster of thunderstorms will exit the province early Tuesday morning.\n\nThis severe thunderstorm watch may be expanded to include a larger portion of southern Manitoba as the evening progresses and the event unfolds.\n\n###\n\nLarge hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
