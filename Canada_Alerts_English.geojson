				"Summary" : "Description: A complex early season winter storm will affect southern Manitoba on Thursday.  A band of snow that affected the Parklands region today will gradually move eastward and weaken tonight, giving another few cm snowfall to western Manitoba.  In it's wake, however, a powerful system will move into the Dakotas overnight, spreading precipitation into much of southern Manitoba.  Current indications are that during the day Thursday the transition from rain to snow will set up roughly along the Red River Valley, including the city of Winnipeg.  Thus, areas west of Winnipeg will likely see significant snow during the day Thursday, while areas east of the city will remain as rain.  Winnipeg itself should see a rain/snow mix.  \n\nSnowfall accumulations are highly uncertain given the rain/snow mix and surface melting.  However, it seems likely that the area west of Winnipeg and east of Brandon will see around 10 cm wet snow on the ground by Thursday evening.\n\nThe rain/snow line will push a little further east Thursday night.  Winnipeg should see around 5 cm snow by Friday morning, again with higher accumulations further west.  \n\nTotal snowfall accumulations in the warned area should range from 15  to 25 cm by Friday morning.\n\nThe snow will be driven by winds gusting as high as 60 km/h.  Temperatures will hover around the zero mark.  Driving conditions are expected to deteriorate significantly as the storm wears on.\n\nIn the longer range...additional rain or snow is expected Friday and Saturday...with significant snowfall again more likely west of Winnipeg.\n\nTravel will be significantly affected.  Consider changing travel plans in the affected areas.  This is an evolving winter storm...watch for updated forecasts and warnings.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: An early season winter storm will affect southern Manitoba late this week into the holiday weekend.  The system which has already developed in Colorado will move northward through the remainder of the work week, eventually stalling over the Lake of the Woods area by Saturday.  Precipitation associated with this system has already moved into western Manitoba where some areas saw more than 10 cm fall on Wednesday.\n\nThis storm will bring significant precipitation to much of southern Manitoba, much of it falling as a wintery rain/snow mix.  Snowfall accumulations are highly uncertain at the moment, however it seems as though the highest amounts will be west of Winnipeg, where total snowfall accumulations exceeding 30 cm are possible by the end of the day Saturday.  East of Winnipeg the majority of the precipitation should fall as rain.\n\nWinnipeg lies near the dividing line between these rain and snow regimes. It is likely the city will see an accumulation of wet snow Thursday or Thursday night. \n\nThe snow will be accompanied by strong north winds, with temperatures hovering around the freezing mark.\n\nTravel will be significantly affected, especially west of Winnipeg.  Consider altering travel plans.  Watch for updated forecasts and warnings.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-10-10T18:32:21-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-10-10T02:33:21-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0697107577.2019<br>Area: City of Winnipeg, R.M. of Gimli incl.

				"Summary" : "Description: An early season winter storm will affect southern Manitoba late this week into the holiday weekend.  The system which has already developed in Colorado will move northward through the remainder of the work week, eventually stalling over the Lake of the Woods area by Saturday.  Precipitation associated with this system has already moved into western Manitoba where some areas saw more than 10 cm fall on Wednesday.\n\nThis storm will bring significant precipitation to much of southern Manitoba, much of it falling as a wintery rain/snow mix.  Snowfall accumulations are highly uncertain at the moment, however it seems as though the highest amounts will be west of Winnipeg, where total snowfall accumulations exceeding 30 cm are possible by the end of the day Saturday.  East of Winnipeg the majority of the precipitation should fall as rain.\n\nWinnipeg lies near the dividing line between these rain and snow regimes. It is likely the city will see an accumulation of wet snow Thursday or Thursday night. \n\nThe snow will be accompanied by strong north winds, with temperatures hovering around the freezing mark.\n\nTravel will be significantly affected, especially west of Winnipeg.  Consider altering travel plans.  Watch for updated forecasts and warnings.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
