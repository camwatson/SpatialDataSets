				"Summary" : "Description: Significant snowfall amounts possible in snow squalls on Friday.\n\nTotal snowfall: generally 2 to 4 cm, with locally 10 cm or more possible in snow squalls.\n\nTime span: early Friday to Friday night.\n\nRemarks: A blowing snow advisory is already in effect for poor visibility expected later tonight into early Friday.  This alert is also in effect due to the possibility of locally heavy accumulations in snow squalls on Friday.  Snow squalls will taper to flurries on Friday night.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to NLstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #NLwx.<br>Expires: 2021-02-26T17:32:16-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2021-02-26T01:33:16-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1998690891.2021<br>Area: Channel-Port aux Basques and vicinity, Corner Brook and vicinity, Gros Morne, Bay St. George",
