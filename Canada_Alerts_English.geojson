				"Summary" : "Description: For Post-tropical Storm Dorian.\n\nThe next intermediate statement will be issued at 12:00 p.m. ADT.\nFollowed by the full information statement issued at 03:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nThe center of Post-Tropical cyclone Dorian is now over the northeastern Gulf of St Lawrence. Dorian will slowly weaken as it moves northeastward across northern Newfoundland later today and east of Labrador tonight.\n\n1. Summary of basic information at 09:00 a.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: Near 49.4 North 59.9 West.\n\nAbout: 190 km west-southwest of Daniels Harbour, Newfoundland.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 130 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: northeast at 43 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 964 millibars.\n\n\n2. Public weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nDorian is currently moving through the northeastern Gulf of St Lawrence and is slowly weakening. However it is still producing high winds and heavy rain.\n\nStrong winds and heavy rain will continue to impact parts of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, the Magdalen Islands and the Quebec's Lower North Shore early this morning. Winds over parts of Nova Scotia and southwestern New Brunswick will continue to diminish this morning, and any remaining warnings there will be ended later today. Large waves and ocean swells will continue along the Atlantic coasts of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and for eastern portions of the Gulf of St. Lawrence today. Elevated water levels and storm surge over parts of eastern New Brunswick will subside this morning. Elevated water levels are expected along Anticosti Island and parts of Quebec's Lower North Shore. \n\nHurricane warnings will be ended this morning for eastern Nova Scotia but will be maintained for Newfoundland.  The Tropical Storm warning will be ended for Prince Edward Island this morning.\n\nTropical storm warnings are continued for parts of northern and southwestern Newfoundland, the Magdalen Islands and parts of Quebec's Lower North Shore. \n\n\na. Wind.\n\nMany of the regions in and bordering the Gulf of St Lawrence will continue to be impacted by potentially damaging winds this morning. Wind impacts will likely be enhanced by foliage on the trees, causing broken branches, some tree falls, and power outages. The most likely areas will be for Cape Breton Island and western and northern Newfoundland.\n\nb. Rainfall.\n\nRainfall warnings are continued the Gaspe Peninsula, and parts of the Quebec Lower North Shore. They will probably end the warnings later today or this evening.\n\nc.

Waves of 4 to 8 metres will impact north facing coasts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Note that waves will break higher along some of the coastlines, and dangerous rip currents are likely. Please exercise extreme caution. \n\n\n3. Marine weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nHurricane force wind warnings remain in effect for most waters in and around the Gulf of St Lawrence. Storm and gale warnings are in effect for adjacent Maritimes waters, and for Newfoundland marine waters in the path or Dorian.\n\nSignificant wave heights of 6 to 10 metres are occurring in offshore waters south of Nova Scotia, and these will move into the southwest coast of Newfoundland this morning. Waves of 4 to 7 metres will develop over Gulf of St Lawrence waters this morning. Late today into Monday waves will build to 4 to 7 metres, and  up to near 5 metres over the Grand Banks.\n\nForecasters: Mercer/Hatt\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-09-08T23:59:06-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-09-08T11:49:06-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1820996897.2019<br>Area: Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I., Avalon Peninsula North, Avalon Peninsula Southeast, St. John's and vicinity, Avalon Peninsula Southwest, Burin Peninsula, Connaigre, Burgeo - Ramea, Channel-Port aux Basques and vicinity, Corner Brook and vicinity, Deer Lake - Humber Valley, Gros Morne, Bay St. George, Buchans and the interior, Grand Falls-Windsor and vicinity, Bay of Exploits, Bonavista North, Bonavista Peninsula, Clarenville and vicinity, Gander and vicinity, Green Bay - White Bay, Terra Nova, Northern Peninsula East, Parson's Pond - Hawke's Bay, Port Saunders and the Straits, Red Bay to L'Anse-au-Clair, Norman Bay to Lodge Bay, Cartwright to Black Tickle, Eagle River, Chevery, Blanc-Sablon, Anticosti, Îles-de-la-Madeleine",

Strong winds gusting up to 110 km/h are expected, especially along coastal areas.\n\n###\n\nThis could result in some damage to docks and breakwaters. Shoreline erosion and wave overwash is expected where winds blow onshore.\n\nA tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds near 65 km/h or more) are expected over parts of the region within 24 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hurricane force winds of 90 gusting to 130 km/h at exposed locations except 120 gusting to 150 km/h at the coast with surge of 0.7 to 1.0 m and waves from 4 to 7 m from Hurricane Dorian are expected.\n\nHurricane conditions are expected to develop this morning as Dorian quickly approaches the region.\n\nThe current track has Dorian moving over the eastern Gulf of St. Lawrence this morning and then over the northern Peninsula this afternoon. Winds gusting up to 150 km/h are expected, especially along coastal areas.\n\n###\n\nThese winds will topple many trees leading to downed utility lines and extended service outages. Moderate to significant damage to roofing materials, exterior cladding and light structures is likely. This could result in some damage to docks and breakwaters. Shoreline erosion and wave overwash is expected where winds blow onshore.\n\nA hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected over parts of the region within 24 hours. Hurricane conditions include (A) sustained winds near 120 km/h or more, and/or (B) significantly elevated water levels and dangerous surf along the coast.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. Reports of storm conditions and impacts can be emailed directly to NSstorm@canada.ca or by tweeting reports by province using #NSStorm, #NBStorm, #PEStorm, #NLwx, #QCStorm or #ONStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-09-09T01:59:44-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-09-08T13:33:44-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2978114603.2019<br>Area: Channel-Port aux Basques and vicinity, Corner Brook and vicinity, Gros Morne, Bay St. George, Parson's Pond - Hawke's Bay",
