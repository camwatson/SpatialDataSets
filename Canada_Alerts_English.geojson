				"Summary" : "Description: More snow expected on Sunday.\n\nLocations: much of Newfoundland (excluding the Great Northern Peninsula).\n\nTotal snowfall: generally 10 to 15 cm, with potentially more than 20 cm over some areas.\n\nRemarks: A fast-moving weather system will bring snow to much of the island on Sunday. While it is too soon to determine exactly where the heaviest accumulations will occur, the potential exists for significant amounts over some locations. The snow may also change to rain over southern coastal areas before ending.\n\nGusty easterly winds accompanying the snow will result in blowing snow and reduced visibilities.\n\nConditions are expected to improve over southern and western Newfoundland on Sunday afternoon, and elsewhere Sunday night.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
