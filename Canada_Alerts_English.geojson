				"Summary" : "Description: Late season snow over highway passes overnight through Friday morning\n\nA cold upper trough moving through British Columbia will give some late season flurries to the mountain passes and northern British Columbia overnight and Friday morning.\n\nFlurries are expected above 1300-1500m elevation, however flurries could briefly descend lower during periods of intense flurry activity. Most southern highway passes are forecast to receive about 2 to 5 cm of wet snow overnight through Friday morning with a locally higher amount up to 10 cm possible over the Okanagan Connector.  \n\nOver northern BC, the Alaska Highway (Highway 97) from the Rocky Mountain foothills to the Liard River can also expect flurries overnight.\n\nPrecipitation will change back to rain on Friday as the airmass begins to warm.\n\nMotorists and those venturing outdoors are encouraged to be prepared for winter-like conditions.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Late season snow over highway passes overnight through Friday morning\n\nA cold upper trough moving through British Columbia will give some late season flurries to the mountain passes and northern British Columbia overnight and Friday morning.\n\nFlurries are expected above 1300-1500m elevation, however flurries could briefly descend lower during periods of intense flurry activity. Most southern highway passes are forecast to receive about 2 to 5 cm of wet snow overnight through Friday morning with a locally higher amount up to 10 cm possible over the Okanagan Connector.  \n\nOver northern BC, the Alaska Highway (Highway 97) from the Rocky Mountain foothills to the Liard River can also expect flurries overnight.\n\nPrecipitation will change back to rain on Friday as the airmass begins to warm.\n\nMotorists and those venturing outdoors are encouraged to be prepared for winter-like conditions.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2019-06-07T02:48:22-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-06-06T18:49:22-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.4005040428.2019<br>Area: Highway 3 - Hope to Princeton via Allison Pass, Highway 3 - Paulson Summit to Kootenay Pass, Highway 97 - Pine Pass, Coquihalla Highway - Hope to Merritt, Coquihalla Highway - Merritt to Kamloops, Okanagan Connector - Merritt to Kelowna, Trans-Canada Highway - Eagle Pass to Rogers Pass, Yellowhead Highway – Tête Jaune Cache to the Alberta Border",

Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-06-07T03:01:56-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-06-06T11:02:56-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3214057870.2019<br>Area: Mackenzie Co. near Bistcho Lake, Mackenzie Co. near Rainbow Lake Zama Lake and Chateh, Mackenzie Co. near Zama City, Mackenzie Co. near Indian Cabins and Steen River, Mackenzie Co. near Meander River and Lutose, Mackenzie Co. near High Level and Bushe River Res., Co. of Northern Lights near Paddle Prairie Smt, Mackenzie Co. near the Caribou Mountains, Mackenzie Co. near Fort Vermilion, Mackenzie Co. near John D'or Prairie and Fox Lake, Mackenzie Co. near La Crête and Buffalo Head Prairie, Mackenzie Co. near the Tallcree and Wadlin Lake Reserves, Clear Hills Co. near Chinchaga Wildland Prov.
