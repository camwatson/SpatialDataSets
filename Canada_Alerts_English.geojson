				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nA low pressure trough will push eastward across Saskatchewan tonight and Wednesday. As the trough moves through it will continue to trigger thunderstorms, some of which will likely become severe throughout the night as it encounters the warm, humid, and unstable airmass already in place.\n\nThe severe thunderstorm watch has ended for Regina as well as points west and south, but has been expanded to include regions from Moosomin through Kamsack.\n\n###\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
