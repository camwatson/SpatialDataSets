				"Summary" : "Description: At 12:21 a.m. CST, Environment Canada meteorologists are tracking a severe thunderstorm capable of producing very strong wind gusts, up to nickel size hail and heavy rain.\n\nThere are currently two lines of thunderstorms tracking through southern Saskatchewan.\n\nOne stretches from west of Preeceville to Dysart, and the second stretches from north of Moose Jaw to east of Val Marie. Both lines of thunderstorms are tracking to the northeast at 20 km/h.\n\nVery heavy rainfall in excess of 50 mm per hour is likely with these lines of thunderstorms.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2019-08-23T08:59:11-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-08-23T06:22:11-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3316248565.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Val Marie including Val Marie Orkney and Monchy, R.M. of Pinto Creek including Kincaid and Hazenmore, R.M. of Glen McPherson west of Mankota, R.M. of Mankota including Mankota and Ferland, R.M. of Craik including Craik and Aylesbury, R.M. of Sarnia including Holdfast Chamberlain and Dilke, R.M. of Marquis including Tuxford Keeler and Buffalo Pound, R.M. of Dufferin including Bethune and Findlater, R.M. of Rodgers including Coderre and Courval, R.M. of Caron including Caronport and Caron, R.M. of Moose Jaw including Pasqua and Bushell Park, R.M. of Cupar including Southey Cupar and Markinch, R.M. of Lipton including Lipton and Dysart, R.M. of North Qu'Appelle including Fort Qu'Appelle, R.M. of Gravelbourg including Gravelbourg and Bateman, R.M. of Sutton including Mazenod Palmer and Vantage, R.M. of Wood River including Lafleche Woodrow and Melaval, R.M. of Stonehenge including Limerick and Congress, R.M. of Waverley including Glentworth and Fir Mountain, R.M. of Hazel Dell including Lintlaw and Hazel Dell, R.M. of Invermay including Invermay and Rama, R.M. of Emerald including Wishart and Bankend, R.M. of Kellross including Kelliher and Lestock, R.M. of Sasman including Margo Kylemore and Nut Mountain, R.M. of Foam Lake including Foam Lake and Fishing Lake Res., R.M. of Ituna Bon Accord including Ituna and Hubbard",
