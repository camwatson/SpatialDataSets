Levels tend to be highest around busy roads and industrial operations. This advisory is in effect until further notice.\n\nPersons with chronic underlying medical conditions should postpone strenuous exercise near busy roads until the advisory is lifted.  Exposure is particularly a concern for pregnant women, infants, the elderly and those who have diabetes, and lung or heart disease.\n\nReal-time air quality observations and information regarding the health effects of air pollution can be found at  https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2020-03-20T03:56:19-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

There is the risk that isolated thunderstorms overnight could contain wind gusts to 90 km/h.\n\nA greater threat for high wind gusts is expected Friday morning into early afternoon as a cold front approaches, preceded by a band of scattered showers and thunderstorms.  There will be potential for wind gusts of 90 km/h as the band moves through.\n\nShould these winds develop, power outages would likely occur in some areas.\n\nEnvironment Canada will continue to monitor this situation closely and may issue watches or warnings as the event draws nearer.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
