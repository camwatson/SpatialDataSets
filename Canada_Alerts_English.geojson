The snow will change through ice pellets and freezing rain to rain on Saturday. Central and inland areas of coastal Labrador could see several hours of freezing rain during the changeover.  The rainfall, combined with temperatures well above zero on Sunday could result in significant snowmelt in some areas, especially coastal areas south of Groswater Bay.     \n \nAnyone planning weather sensitive activities is advised to plan ahead.

				"Summary" : "Description: Significant rain, freezing rain, snow and wind for this weekend.\n\nTotal snowfall: 5 to 10 cm over northernmost regions.\n\nTotal rainfall: 20 to 30 mm over northern and eastern regions. \n                     30 to 60 mm over southwestern regions.\n                     \n\nMaximum wind gusts: easterly becoming southerly with gusts between 50 and 80 km/h.\n\nLocations: New Brunswick.\n\nTime span: Saturday morning until Sunday morning.\n\nRemarks: Snow is expected to begin overnight tonight over northern regions, and then transition through freezing rain to rain on Saturday. Over central regions, some freezing rain is likely in the morning before temperatures slowly climb above the freezing mark. Over southern regions, rain will prevail for most of the day as strong southerly winds quickly push temperatures well above the freezing mark, leading to significant snow melt and run off. \n\nA rainfall warning has been issued for southwestern portions of the province.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
