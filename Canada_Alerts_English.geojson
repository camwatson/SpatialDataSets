				"Summary" : "Description: Heavy snow possible late this evening into early Wednesday.\n\nSnowfall may become heavy at times for a few hours overnight with many areas receiving up to 10 cm by Wednesday morning.\n\nThis snow is a result of a low pressure system from the Southern Plains States that will spread across parts of Northwestern Ontario tonight. \n\nThe snow will quickly end Wednesday morning as the low pressure area races across Northeastern Ontario into Quebec. \n\nHazardous winter driving conditions are expected tonight. Untreated roads may become snow covered and slippery. Low visibility in heavy snow may also be an issue to deal with. \n\nSnowfall warnings may be required as this event draws closer.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A weather system moving in from Alberta will spread snow into western Saskatchewan this evening and over the remainder of the province on Wednesday. The system will weaken somewhat as it moves east on Wednesday, leaving the highest snowfalls over western regions. \n\nIn addition to the snow, northwest winds gusting to 50 or 60 km/h will produce pockets of blowing snow especially in areas west of Swift Current near the Trans Canada Highway. The worst conditions are likely between midnight and noon. \n\nTotal snowfall accumulations of 5 to 10 cm are expected in parts of the southwest, with slightly higher amounts possible just north of the Cypress Hills. Snowfall amounts will lessen as you go east. \n\nTravellers should be prepared for poor road conditions in these regions. Please listen for updated forecasts and special weather statements.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Untreated roads may become snow covered and slippery. Very low to near zero visibility in bursts of heavy snow is possible.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult.
