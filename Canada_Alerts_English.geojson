				"Summary" : "Description: 15 cm of heavy snow today.\n\nSnow, heavy at times will continue into this afternoon, with total amounts near 15 cm expected across Southwestern Ontario. \n\nStrong southeasterly winds will whip up the freshly fallen snow causing very low visibility at times in blowing snow mostly this morning.\n\nThe snow will taper off to a mixture of showers and wet flurries this afternoon south of a line from Grand Bend to St. Marys. North of this line the snow may turn over briefly to a mix of wet flurries and showers early this evening. \n\nAs cold arctic air returns again by Sunday, snow squalls in a brisk northwesterly flow off of Lake Huron are expected to affect the region beginning Sunday morning. Snow squall watches may be issued as this event draws closer.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA strong Pacific storm has arrived with a mix of wintery weather including snow and freezing rain for the Fraser Valley. As warmer air associated with storm penetrates the region, the snow will transition to freezing rain then to rain. The phase changes will occur this morning and afternoon over western sections and later today and tonight over eastern sections, including Hope.\n\nTotal snowfall accumulations will range from near 5 cm in the west to 10 cm in the east.\n\nTiming this transition from snow to freezing rain is always challenging in these situations. There is a chance that this transition could be delayed resulting in higher snowfall amounts.\n\nStay tuned to the latest Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest warnings and forecasts.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and hazardous.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Expect strong winds and visibility frequently near zero in snow and blowing snow.\n\nAn approaching Pacific storm has spread snow to the region. At the same time, the approaching system will also increase the draw of cold air out from the interior resulting in very strong outflow winds through the inlets and valleys. This combination will result in near zero visibility in blowing snow and extreme wind chill values.\n\nThe strong outflow winds are expected to moderate this afternoon, but periods of heavy snow will continue tonight into Sunday.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be extremely hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least 4 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
