Maximum daytime temperatures of 31 degrees are possible with overnight minimum temperatures likely remaining near 21 degrees providing little relief from the heat. \n\nScattered showers and thunderstorms are possible each day which could prevent maximum daytime highs reaching 31 degrees. However, maximum humidex values are still expected to be near 40. The hot and humid conditions are expected to remain in the area until the weekend.\n\nA cold front is expected to move through on Saturday and bring cooler conditions to the area.\n\n###\n\nExtreme heat affects everyone.\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
