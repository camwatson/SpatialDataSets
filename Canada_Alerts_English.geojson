As a result, most areas will see at least a couple of hours of poor visibility in snow and blowing snow prior to the snow transitioning through ice pellets and/or freezing rain to rain during the day on Wednesday.  The transition will be much slower over northern Newfoundland where significant snowfall accumulations are expected on Wednesday.  Snowfall warnings may be required for some areas.\n\nThe worst of the precipitation and wind will move out of the area by Thursday morning.\n\nAdditionally, high waves, pounding surf and higher than normal water levels are expected along the south coast of Newfoundland on Wednesday from Port aux Basques to the Connaigre Peninsula.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
