As colder air from the north filters in and causes temperatures to drop to near or a little below the zero degree mark, freezing rain may develop and persist for a few hours overnight. The freezing rain will end Wednesday morning as the low races across Northeastern Ontario into Quebec.\n\nDriving conditions may deteriorate tonight. Untreated roads may become icy and slippery. \n\nFreezing rain warnings may be required as this event draws closer.\n\n.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Heavy snow possible late this evening into early Wednesday.\n\nSnowfall may become heavy at times for a few hours overnight with many areas receiving up to 10 cm by Wednesday morning.\n\nThis snow is a result of a low pressure system from the Southern Plains States that will spread across parts of Northwestern Ontario tonight. \n\nThe snow will quickly end Wednesday morning as the low pressure area races across Northeastern Ontario into Quebec. \n\nHazardous winter driving conditions are expected tonight. Untreated roads may become snow covered and slippery. Low visibility in heavy snow may also be an issue to deal with. \n\nSnowfall warnings may be required as this event draws closer.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
