Gusty winds will accompany these snow squalls at times resulting in periods of blowing snow.\n\nThese snow squalls are expected through Wednesday, but will slowly shift southward as the wind becomes northwesterly by Wednesday evening. Additional snowfall accumulations of 15 cm are possible Wednesday night particularly for areas near and south of Parry Sound.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.

The most intense snow squalls are likely this afternoon and evening. \n\nLocal snowfall accumulations near 20 cm will be possible under the most intense snow squalls by Wednesday morning. Gusty winds will accompany these snow squalls at times resulting in periods of blowing snow.\n\nWinds will become southwesterly by Wednesday morning, shifting the snow squalls northward to mainly affect Bruce County and northern Grey County on Wednesday. Additional snowfall accumulations of 15 cm are expected in these regions on Wednesday.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.
