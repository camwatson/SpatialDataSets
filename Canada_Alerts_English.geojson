Warm temperatures will continue tonight, with overnight lows near 20.  \n\nSunday will be somewhat unsettled with a good chance of thunderstorms and continuing warm with highs near the 30 mark but with significantly less humidity. Passage of a cold front will bring a return to more seasonal conditions on Monday, with daytime highs in the mid twenties.\n\nWidespread hot and humid conditions also continued across most of southern and central Manitoba, although this remains just shy of heat warning criteria.\n\n###\n\nExtreme heat affects everyone.\n\nWatch for the effects of heat illness: swelling, rash, cramps, fainting, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and the worsening of some health conditions.\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nFor more information on heat and your health:\n- Visit Manitoba Health at: http://www.manitoba.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/heat.html. \n- Call Health Links – Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
