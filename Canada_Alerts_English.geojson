Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nSnow squalls continuing through tonight.\n\nLocal snowfall amounts of 10 to 25 cm are possible.\n\nThese snow squalls are expected to shift early this evening as the winds become northwesterly. Snow squalls will become more isolated on Thursday morning.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
