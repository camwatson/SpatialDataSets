Precipitation is expected to begin as rain and then transition to freezing rain or snow as temperatures fall to near or slightly below the freezing mark. Freezing rain may persist for several hours before changing to snow Saturday morning. \n\nSnow will continue into Saturday night before tapering off on Sunday morning. Total snowfall amounts of 15 cm are possible. \n\nIn addition, strong northeasterly winds of 40 gusting to 60 km/h, combined with snow, may result in blowing snow and reduced visibility.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
