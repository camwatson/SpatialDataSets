The highest likelihood of accumulating snow will be overnight Saturday into Sunday morning when road surface temperatures approach zero degrees Celsius. \n\nTemperatures will return to seasonal values beginning on Tuesday.\n\nMotorists should be prepared for the potential of snow and slippery road conditions and are encouraged to check road conditions on DriveBC and www.511yukon.ca before heading out.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
