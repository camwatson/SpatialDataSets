				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from wildfires in northern Alberta is causing poor air quality and reducing visibility over portions of the province.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-06-03T13:35:00-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-06-02T21:36:00-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0284727696.2019<br>Area: Lac La Biche Co. near Plamondon Hylo and Avenir, Lac La Biche Co. near Heart Lake, Lac La Biche Co. near Lac La Biche and Square Lake, Lac La Biche Co. near Lakeland Prov.

Very light northerly winds have been affecting the area, but they are expected to become more southerly or southeasterly by Monday which may bring the smoke back into the Pikangikum area.   \n\nThe town of Red Lake and surrounding areas may experience smoke today and tonight before the wind shifts.\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nIf you, or someone in your care, develop symptoms, reduce or reschedule strenuous outdoors activities where ever possible until the air quality improves.\n\n###\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-06-03T11:21:45-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the Province of Ontario, 2019-06-02T19:22:45-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1540542594.2019<br>Area: Pikangikum - Poplar Hill - MacDowell, Red Lake - Woodland Caribou Park, Ear Falls - Perrault Falls - Western Lac Seul",
