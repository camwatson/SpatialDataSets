Communities immediately near the water such as Comox, Parksville, Nanaimo and lower elevations of Metro Vancouver will see up to 5 cm of snow. Rain or wet snow is possible for these regions as well with no accumulations.\n\nHigher elevations and inland sections of Metro Vancouver, Fraser Valley - West, Vancouver Island and Sunshine Coast will see higher accumulations.\n\nAt this time, elevations near 300 metres of Metro Vancouver could see up to 10 cm of snow. Inland and higher elevations of East Vancouver Island could see 10 to 15 cm.\n\nThe Malahat Highway will see 15 cm of snow by Monday.\n\nPrecipitation is expected to ease this afternoon and then return this evening. Snowfall accumulations tonight and Monday will mainly be over higher elevations.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
