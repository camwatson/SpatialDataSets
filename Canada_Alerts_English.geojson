Widespread snow will transition to more localized/variable lake effect snow squalls Friday morning. \n\nDiscussion:\nRain will continue through Thursday morning before switching over to snow from west to east. Snow may be occasionally heavy at times overnight into Friday morning, before giving way to a lake effect snow squall event. Lake effect snow should last into Saturday, and will be accompanied by local whiteouts at times in heavy and blowing snow. \n\nA Snow Squall Watch will likely be needed for areas east of Lake Huron and southeast of Georgian Bay to address this concern for Friday and Saturday.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Significant snowfall continues over northern sections tonight.\n\nSnow at times heavy will continue for areas north of Missinaibi Lake tonight and gradually taper to flurries by Thursday afternoon.\n\nTotal snowfall amounts of 10 to 20 cm are expected by Thursday afternoon. Locally higher amounts up to 25 cm are possible for areas closer to Kapuskasing and Hornepayne.\n\nBrisk northerly winds gusting 50 to 60 km/h are expected from this evening into Thursday and will result in localized blowing snow over exposed areas.\n\nAreas south of Missinaibi Lake, which include Chapleau and Sultan, will not receive as much snow. These areas will receive rain showers for much of the night and transition to snow early Thursday morning. The snow should taper to flurries Thursday afternoon. A total snowfall of up to 5 cm is possible for these areas on Thursday.\n\nConsider postponing non-essential travel in the northern areas until conditions improve.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

A transition to freezing rain and/or snow will take place late Thursday afternoon through the evening. \n\nDiscussion: \nScattered showers will gradually turn into periods of rain tonight ahead of an approaching low pressure system. Total rainfall amounts of 15 to 25 mm are likely by this evening.\n\nRain will change to snow late this afternoon and evening. Freezing rain may also be possible during this time. Several hours of freezing rain and snowfall amounts of 10 to 20 cm may be possible by Friday morning in some areas. \n\nMotorists should be prepared for deteriorating winter driving conditions beginning late Thursday afternoon and evening. \n\nUncertainty remains high, but a Freezing Rain Warning and/or a Snowfall Warning may be needed to address these concerns...stay tuned.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
