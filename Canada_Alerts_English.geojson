This may give significant snowfall amounts to most of the province. Winds will possibly reach or exceed warning criteria, especially over eastern regions Thursday night into Friday.\n\nHigh waves and storm surge will affect the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence on Friday.

				"Summary" : "Description: Very strong outflow winds and severely cold wind chill values are expected or occurring.\n\nAn arctic ridge of high pressure will remain over the BC interior over the next few days. This system will continue to produce very strong outflow winds,  frigid temperatures, and wind chill values of minus 20 and below through the week.\n\n###\n\nFrostbite and hypothermia can occur within minutes if adequate precautions are not taken when outdoors.\n\nArctic outflow warnings are issued when bitterly cold air flows from the interior to coastal communities and the outflow winds create wind chill values of -20 or less for 6 hours or more.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
