Visibilities will be rapidly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow.\n\nA brief but intense snow squall associated with a strong cold front will cross the northern Webequie region this evening.\n\nNorthwest winds gusting to 70 km/h combined with heavy snow during the passage of the front will likely result in a brief period of very poor visibility. A general snowfall accumulation of 4 to 8 cm is possible.\n\n###\n\nVisibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Winter Weather Travel Advisory in effect for tonight.\n\nA narrow but possibly intense snow squall band, associated with the passage of a cold front, will move across far northeastern Ontario tonight. This linear snow squall band which extends from roughly Peawanuck southwest towards Ogoki at 11:00 PM EST is expected to move eastward throughout the night. It may reach Attawapiskat and Fort Albany near or after midnight, although it will likely be in a weakened state by that time.\n\nA snowfall accumulation of 4 to 8 cm is possible with this snow squall. Strong winds with gusts of up to 60 km/h are also possible with the passage of the cold front tonight. These winds are expected to ease Friday overnight.\n\nUnder the snow squall bands, visibilities may be reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow. Travel is expected to be hazardous due to the reduced visibility.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The heavy snow and strong winds occurring together will result in blowing snow that will significantly reduce visibilities late this afternoon and this evening. \n\nAs the cold front moves east, the heavy snow will taper to flurries late in the evening, however the winds will remain strong and could continue to whip up the freshly fallen snow. Wind chill values of -40 to -44 are likely overnight and early Saturday morning as well in the Fort Severn area.\n\nConditions are expected to improve early Saturday morning as the winds diminish.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlowing snow advisories are issued when winds are expected to create blowing snow giving poor visibility to 800 metres or less for at least 3 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
