				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions will be favourable for the development of funnel clouds today.\n\n\n###\n\nThese types of funnel clouds are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nLandspout tornadoes do not usually cause significant damage but can still be dangerous. They can be strong enough to topple trees, damage roofs or toss debris short distances.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions will be favourable for the development of funnel clouds today.\n\n\n###\n\nThese types of funnel clouds are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nLandspout tornadoes do not usually cause significant damage but can still be dangerous. They can be strong enough to topple trees, damage roofs or toss debris short distances.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Overnight lows near 20 degrees Celsius are also expected through this period, providing little relief from the heat.\n\nA slightly cooler airmass may move into the area this weekend, however there is considerable uncertainty. A few areas towards eastern Ontario are likely to experience extreme heat on Saturday as well.\n\nPlease refer to your public forecast for further details on expected temperatures.\n\nHot and humid air can also bring deteriorating air quality and can result in the Air Quality Health Index approaching the high risk category.\n\n###\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of very dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing destructive wind gusts, damaging hail and heavy rain.\n\nA significant line of severe thunderstorms has developed over southwestern Saskatchewan and is ongoing. The threat for tornadoes has diminished, however there is still the risk for the development of a tornado embedded in the line while the thunderstorms are ongoing. This watch will continue to be extended to the east as the situation evolves.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Widespread and extremely strong wind gusts can destroy buildings with tornado-like damage, flatten large stands of trees and blow vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The threat for tornadoes has diminished, however there is still a slight risk for the development of a tornado embedded in the line while the thunderstorms are ongoing. This line of thunderstorms will enter Manitoba later this evening and possibly persist through the overnight. This watch may continue to be extended to the east as the situation evolves.\n\n###\n\nWidespread and extremely strong wind gusts can destroy buildings with tornado-like damage, flatten large stands of trees and blow vehicles off the road.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-08T10:59:48-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-08T03:54:48-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1868082667.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Wallace-Woodworth incl.
