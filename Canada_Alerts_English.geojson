				"Summary" : "Description: A major snowfall is expected tonight into Monday.  \n\nA low pressure system is forecast to track across Northeastern Ontario Monday bringing snow to the area. Snow is expected to begin late this evening before becoming heavy tonight. Snow may mix with or change to rain in areas to the east of Chapleau on Monday. There is also the likelihood of freezing rain Monday morning. Snow is expected to taper to flurries Monday night.  Northerly winds gusting near 60 km/h are also likely Monday evening resulting in blowing snow. \n\nTotal snowfall amounts in the 25 to 40 cm range will be possible with the highest amounts west of Chapleau. \n\nExact snowfall amounts and the position of the rain snow line remain uncertain as a slight shift in the track or strength of this low pressure system will significantly change the snowfall and rainfall amounts.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Road closures are possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
