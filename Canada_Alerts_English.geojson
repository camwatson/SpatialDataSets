Severe thunderstorms are possible late this afternoon and this evening.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

There is a risk of localized flash flooding.\n\nThese thunderstorms are along a line from north of Vermillion to the Cold Lake Air Weapons Range and are nearly stationary.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours are likely to cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2019-06-29T23:20:16-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-06-29T20:57:16-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1901351743.2019<br>Area: Improvement District 349 including Cold Lake Air Weapons Range, Co. of St. Paul near Elk Point and St. Edouard, M.D. of Bonnyville near La Corey Wolf Lake and Truman, M.D. of Bonnyville near Glendon and Moose Lake, M.D. of Bonnyville near Bonnyville Ardmore and Kehewin Res., Co. of Two Hills near Myrnam and Derwent",
