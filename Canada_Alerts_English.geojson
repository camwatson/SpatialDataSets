				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions will be favourable for the development of funnel clouds today.\n\n\n###\n\nThese types of funnel clouds are generated by weak rotation under rapidly growing clouds or weak thunderstorms. This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nIf conditions become more favourable for the development of landspout tornadoes, watches and warnings will be issued by Environment Canada.\n\nLandspout tornadoes do not usually cause significant damage but can still be dangerous. They can be strong enough to topple trees, damage roofs or toss debris short distances.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-06-11T04:54:41-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-10T21:18:41-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1572962252.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Wallace-Woodworth incl.

Torrential downpours are likely, and large hail is possible.\n\n###\n\nStrong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.<br>Expires: 2020-06-10T23:59:51-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-10T21:20:51-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2640082212.2020<br>Area: Bruce Peninsula - Sauble Beach - Tobermory, Owen Sound - Blue Mountains - Northern Grey County, Saugeen Shores - Kincardine - Southern Bruce County, Hanover - Dundalk - Southern Grey County, Wingham - Blyth - Northern Huron County, Goderich - Bluewater - Southern Huron County",

Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.<br>Expires: 2020-06-10T23:59:47-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-10T21:00:47-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.4262669864.2020<br>Area: Bruce Peninsula - Sauble Beach - Tobermory, Saugeen Shores - Kincardine - Southern Bruce County, Wingham - Blyth - Northern Huron County, Goderich - Bluewater - Southern Huron County",

Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.<br>Expires: 2020-06-11T02:00:23-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-10T22:21:23-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3048813418.2020<br>Area: London - Parkhill - Eastern Middlesex County, Strathroy - Komoka - Western Middlesex County, St. Thomas - Aylmer - Eastern Elgin County, Rodney - Shedden - Western Elgin County, Woodstock - Tillsonburg - Oxford County",
