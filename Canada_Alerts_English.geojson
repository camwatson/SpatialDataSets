Rain will fall over most of the highway with wet snow or rain mixed with snow near at summit.\n\nAs the cold front approaches Sunday night, precipitation rates will intensify and thus there is potential for snow levels to drop just below the summit or pass levels, resulting in heavy accumulating snow up to 15 cm.\n\nMotorists are advised to be aware of changing weather and road conditions due to fluctuating snow levels and precipitation intensity during this period.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
