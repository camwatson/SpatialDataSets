				"Summary" : "Description: Brief, intense snowfall is expected to develop. Under the snow squall, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for brief but intense bursts of heavy snow producing near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA system which moved eastward across central Alberta  brought snow and some freezing rain to many areas.  At this time, all of the freezing rain has moved into Saskatchewan but some heavy snow is lingering back into Alberta. \n\nThe precipitation will move completely out of the region this evening. \n\nTotal Snowfall accumulations between 10 and 20 cm are expected from the storm before it moves into Saskatchewan.\n\nIn addition gusty winds will also generate blowing snow at times this evening until the system completely exits the province.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and hazardous.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA system moved into Saskatchewan from Alberta bringing with it freezing rain and heavy snow. The storm will continue to move east this evening and precipitation will gradually ease overnight from the west. At this time the freezing rain will likely be confined to Laronge and Pelican Narrows Regions as the warmer air aloft necessary for freezing rain moves further east. \n\nSnowfall accumulations between 10 and 20 cm are expected.  5 to 8  mm of ice build-up is possible due to the freezing rain.  \n\nGusty winds will generate blowing snow at times in open areas.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and hazardous.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Brief, intense snowfall is expected to develop. Under the snow squall, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow.\n\nBrief squalls of snow and wind are expected over southern Saskatchewan.\n\nSnow squalls, with brief near-zero visibilites in snow and blowing snow, will form in parts of southern Saskatchewan this evening and tonight. While a squall may only last less than an hour, whiteout conditions are likely with any squall that does occur.\n\nThe potential for snow squalls will end overnight.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for brief but intense bursts of heavy snow producing near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
