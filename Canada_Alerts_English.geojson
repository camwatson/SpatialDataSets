				"Summary" : "Description: Potential winter storm to come later this week ...\n\nA major low pressure system from the United States will affect Southwestern Quebec beginning Wednesday and spread eastward through Friday.\n\nThis system will bring heavy snow over most areas, with amounts upwards of 15 cm that could reach more than 25 cm over some areas. However, snow should quickly change to rain over Extreme Southern Quebec late Wednesday with the risk of freezing rain during the changeover.\n\nAdditionally, strong winds will accompany this system, giving blowing snow over more exposed areas, especially along the St Lawrence Estuary and the Gulf of St Lawrence.\n\nExpect poor driving conditions due to low visibility and quickly accumulating snow or water on roads. Motorists should consider advancing or postponing their travel plans.\n\nMore detailed information will be issued over the next few days as\nthe track of the system becomes more certain.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.
