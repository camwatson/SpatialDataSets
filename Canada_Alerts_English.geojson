Quarter-szied hail has been reported with these thunderstorms.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Fast-moving water across a road can sweep a vehicle away. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2020-07-23T18:39:56-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-23T15:45:56-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2747581662.2020<br>Area: Mun. of Glenboro-South Cypress incl.

Quarter-szied hail has been reported with these thunderstorms.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Fast-moving water across a road can sweep a vehicle away.

Park northeast toward Spruce Woods Prov. Park, and is moving toward the east at 25 km/h. Quarter-szied hail has been reported with these thunderstorms.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Fast-moving water across a road can sweep a vehicle away. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2020-07-23T17:44:38-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-23T14:45:38-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0450176511.2020<br>Area: Mun. of North Cypress-Langford incl.
