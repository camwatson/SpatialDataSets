				"Summary" : "Description: Early August Heavy Rainfall for Vancouver Island and the South Coast of British Columbia.\n\nAn unseasonably strong Pacific front is poised to drench Vancouver Island and parts of the south coast beginning on Thursday. The system will tap into subtropical moisture which will amplify the front and help to enhance the rainfall.\n\nThe main area of rain will begin over west and inland Vancouver Island Thursday morning. The rain will spread to areas of east Vancouver Island from Nanaimo to the Comox Valley, and over the Sunshine Coast later in the morning and will intensify and become heavy on Thursday afternoon. \n\nOver Howe Sound, Whistler, and northern sections of Metro Vancouver there may be some scattered showers on Thursday ahead of the main plume of moisture associated with the front. The main area of rain will develop later on Thursday afternoon and Thursday evening as the front moves eastward. \n\nThe continuous rain will end Thursday night as the front pushes eastward. In the wake of the front, there will be showers with a risk of thunderstorms and gusty winds through Friday. \n\nThere remains some uncertainty with respect to the location of where the heaviest precipitation amounts will occur. Stay tuned to Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest forecasts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
