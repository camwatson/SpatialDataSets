				"Summary" : "Description: Occasional snow squalls are expected.\n\nLocations: western Newfoundland.\n\nTime span: tonight.\n\nTotal snowfall accumulations: near 5 cm.\n\nRemarks: strong southwesterly winds will combine with periodic snow squalls to produce reduced visibility in blowing snow.  Conditions favourable for snow squalls will diminish overnight.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
