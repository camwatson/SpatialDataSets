Through the afternoon the band will drift south, reaching downtown Hamilton in the evening. Snowfall amounts of 5 to 10 cm are possible by Wednesday overnight with snowfall rates of several centimeters per hour likely.\n\nUnder the lake effect bands heavy bursts of snow and blowing snow can significantly reduce visibilities.\n\nMotorists are advised to exercise caution and be prepared for quickly changing driving conditions.
