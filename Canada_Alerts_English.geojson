				"Summary" : "Description: Smoke from forest fires over eastern Manitoba and northwestern Ontario continues to linger over east central and northeastern portions of the province. \n\nOver northeastern Manitoba ...\nSmoke will linger over the region tonight.\nA cold front tracking across the region will bring improved conditions by late Tuesday as northerly winds behind the front move the smoke southward.  \n\nOver south central and southeastern Manitoba ...\nThe air quality over southeastern Manitoba has improved as southerly winds have dispersed and pushed the smoke to the north. However, the aforementioned cold front will move the smoke back into the area Tuesday night and air quality statements will likely be reissued for these areas by Wednesday morning.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nDue to the smoky conditions, individuals living in or travelling to the above noted areas are advised to be aware of potential health concerns that can be associated with current air conditions. In these current conditions, even healthy individuals may experience sore eyes, tears, coughing and a runny nose.\n\nIn areas affected by smoke from wildland fires, Manitobans are encouraged to:\n- limit outdoor activity and/or strenuous physical activity; if breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce the activity\n- reduce exposure to smoke by staying indoors or moving to areas with cleaner air, as conditions can vary dramatically by area\n- turn off furnaces and air-conditioning units that may draw smoke indoors\n- keep indoor air cleaner by avoiding smoking or burning other materials \n\nPeople at higher risk include young children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with heart or lung conditions (particularly asthma), and therefore should avoid as much exposure to smoke as possible.\n\nManitobans with health questions or concerns can contact their health-care provider or call Health Links – Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257. More information on the health effects of smoke is available at www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/smoke.html.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-09T21:06:43-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Manitoba Health, 2019-07-09T05:07:43-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2698378117.2019<br>Area: Manigotagan Black River Res. and Hollow Water Res., Bissett, Nopiming Prov.

				"Summary" : "Description: Elevated pollution levels are expected or occurring.\n\nAIR QUALITY ADVISORY FOR YUKON\n\nThe office of the Yukon Chief Medical Officer of Health has issued an Air Quality Advisory for all Yukon communities due to high or increasing concentrations of wildfire smoke.\n\nWildfires in Alaska and central Yukon are causing increased concentrations of smoke throughout the territory. Local conditions may also affect the concentration of smoke in each community.  Please note that there is no immediate wildfire threat to any Yukon communities.\n\nSmoke can impact your health if it lingers in your community. Please observe the following recommendations: \n\n- You may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, eye or throat irritation, or shortness of breath. If you are experiencing symptoms, limit outdoor activity and/or strenuous physical activity; if breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce the activity.\n\n-\tMake sure you identify and support those who are at increased risk from wildfire smoke. These include small children, elders, pregnant women, and those with lung or heart disease.\n\n-\tIf you have a health condition that could worsen with the smoke (asthma, chronic lung disease or COPD, or heart disease) check in with your health care provider to make sure that you have a plan for managing your condition. Make sure your medications and supplies are available and up-to-date. \n\n-\tReduce exposure to smoky air by staying indoors and turning on an air cleaner with a HEPA filter, if you have one.
