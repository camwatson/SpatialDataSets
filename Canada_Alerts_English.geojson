Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-06-19T08:20:01-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-06-18T16:21:01-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3342325370.2019<br>Area: Mackenzie Co. near Bistcho Lake, Mackenzie Co. near Rainbow Lake Zama Lake and Chateh, Mackenzie Co. near Zama City, Mackenzie Co. near Indian Cabins and Steen River, Mackenzie Co. near Meander River and Lutose, Mackenzie Co. near High Level and Bushe River Res., Co. of Northern Lights near Paddle Prairie Smt, Mackenzie Co. near the Caribou Mountains, Mackenzie Co. near Fort Vermilion, Mackenzie Co. near John D'or Prairie and Fox Lake, Mackenzie Co. near La Crête and Buffalo Head Prairie, Mackenzie Co. near the Tallcree and Wadlin Lake Reserves",
