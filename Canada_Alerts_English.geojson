				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of very dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing destructive wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nA line of thunderstorms continues to track across southwestern Manitoba. The line is beginning to weaken, but some storms, specifically near the US border have the potential to produce significant wind gusts.\n\n###\n\nWidespread and extremely strong wind gusts can destroy buildings with tornado-like damage, flatten large stands of trees and blow vehicles off the road.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-08T10:59:16-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-08T05:36:16-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1731522846.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Wallace-Woodworth incl.
