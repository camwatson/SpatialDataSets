The highest amounts are likely in the northern mainland and Cape Breton.  In the south, it is more likely that the snow will be mixed with rain during the morning then will change over to snow later in the day. However, at this time there is significant uncertainty in the specific intensity and exact locations of the heaviest snow.\n\nAdditionally, strong winds will combine with the fresh snow to create reduced visibilities in blowing snow later in the day and on Sunday night.\n\nAccumulating snow, mixed precipitation and blowing snow will make travel difficult on Sunday, motorists are advised to exercise caution.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
