				"Summary" : "Description: A complex early season winter storm will affect southern Manitoba on Thursday.  A band of snow that affected the Parklands region today will gradually move eastward and weaken tonight, giving another few cm snowfall to western Manitoba.  In it's wake, however, a powerful system will move into the Dakotas overnight, spreading precipitation into much of southern Manitoba.  Current indications are that during the day Thursday the transition from rain to snow will set up roughly along the Red River Valley, including the city of Winnipeg.  Thus, areas west of Winnipeg will likely see significant snow during the day Thursday, while areas east of the city will remain as rain.  Winnipeg itself should see a rain/snow mix.  \n\nSnowfall accumulations are highly uncertain given the rain/snow mix and surface melting.  However, it seems likely that the area west of Winnipeg and east of Brandon will see around 10 cm wet snow on the ground by Thursday evening.\n\nThe rain/snow line will push a little further east Thursday night.  Winnipeg should see around 5 cm snow by Friday morning, again with higher accumulations further west.  \n\nTotal snowfall accumulations in the warned area should range from 15  to 25 cm by Friday morning.\n\nThe snow will be driven by winds gusting as high as 60 km/h.  Temperatures will hover around the zero mark.  Driving conditions are expected to deteriorate significantly as the storm wears on.\n\nIn the longer range...additional rain or snow is expected Friday and Saturday...with significant snowfall again more likely west of Winnipeg.\n\nTravel will be significantly affected.  Consider changing travel plans in the affected areas.  This is an evolving winter storm...watch for updated forecasts and warnings.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Areas under the winter storm watch...including the City of Winnipeg...will escape the brunt of the system today.  However, significant snow and/or winds are likely in the next couple of days, and hence these areas remain under a winter storm watch.  \n\nRain and snow has spread into southern Manitoba this morning, courtesy of an approaching Colorado low.  As anticipated the rain/snow line has set up roughly along the Red River Valley, with western sections of the valley seeing snow and eastern sections seeing rain or a rain/snow mix.  The weather is even sharply different across the city of Winnipeg, with significant snowfall accumulations in the west of the city and little in the east.\n\nIn the worst affected area...roughly from just west of Winnipeg to just east of Brandon...heavy, wet snow will continue throughout the day, accompanied by northerly winds gusting up to 70 km/h. Total accumulations by this evening in this area will range from 10-15 cm. Travelling will become increasingly difficult as the day wears on, with heavy, accumulating snow, strong winds and temperatures near zero resulting in treacherous conditions.\n\nPeriods of heavy snow will continue through Friday into Saturday.  By Friday evening total snowfall accumulations of 30 to 50 cm are quite likely in this area.  Other areas including the City of Winnipeg will see lesser, but still significant snowfall accumulation by Friday evening.\n\nIn addition, very strong northerly winds are forecast for Friday, especially where winds blow onshore off the Manitoba Lakes.  The extreme winds and heavy snowfall will persist into Saturday.\n\nThe combination of wind and wet snow may pose a problem with tree branches or power lines.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations. Poor weather conditions may contribute to transportation delays.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A Colorado low will bring rain (or at times wet snow) to southeastern Manitoba today, Friday, and into Saturday.\n\nRain has tapered off late this morning in this area, but radar shows a second band of precipitation approaching which should begin this afternoon. Widespread rainfall totals of 30 to 50 mm expected to fall by Friday evening. In addition, satellite imagery suggests embedded heavy showers are possible tonight, giving locally higher amounts. The Colorado low will linger in the area Saturday with further rain or snow expected. \n\nNormally these rainfall amounts would not qualify as a heavy rainfall event. However, recent heavy rains in southeastern Manitoba have resulted in saturated ground and localized flooding, which will be made worse with the current storm system.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
