The prolonged moderate to heavy rainfall may result in higher overland runoff. \n\nFlood warnings and advisories from the BC River Forecast Centre can be found at: http://bcrfc.env.gov.bc.ca/warnings/index.htm .\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
