Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nStrong and cold northwest winds blowing over relatively warm Gulf of St. Lawrence waters will make conditions favourable for the development of snow squalls on Saturday. Conditions are expected to persist until Sunday morning as a ridge of high pressure moves over the region.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Conditions are expected to persist until Sunday morning as a ridge of high pressure moves over the region.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Rain, at times heavy, is expected.\n\nHeavy rain is expected for the inland sections of the north and central coasts, the Sunshine Coast and Howe Sound. An atmospheric river will take aim at North Vancouver Island and the Central Coast beginning early Saturday morning delivering heavy rain and mild conditions until mid-day Sunday.  Rainfall amounts of 50 to 70 mm are expected by Sunday morning for the aforementioned regions.\n\nGiven the tropical origin of the atmospheric river, freezing levels will be on the rise upwards of 3000 metres for the South Coast and close to 2500 metres for the North Coast. The mild air will result in rain at almost all elevations. High runoff and rising river levels are likely through the weekend.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
