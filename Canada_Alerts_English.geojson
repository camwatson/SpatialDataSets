Manitoba Infrastructure's Hydrologic Forecast Centre has issued a wind warning for the south basin of Lake Manitoba and shorelines near Gimli on the west and Victoria Beach on the east side of Lake Winnipeg. High winds are forecasted to develop overnight Wednesday and lasting until early morning Thursday. Strong winds from the northwest gusting up to 70 km/hr are expected. Wind speed and wave action could raise water levels as much as five feet or more.
