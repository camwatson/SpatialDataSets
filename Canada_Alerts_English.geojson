				"Summary" : "Description: Smoky Skies Bulletin - July 28, 2019\nThe Regions of BC highlighted on the map are being impacted or are likely to be impacted by wildfire smoke over the next 24-48 hours. \nThe next bulletin update will be available July 29, 2019.\nThe bulletin can be accessed online at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air/air-quality/air-advisories.\n\nBe informed:\nDuring a wildfire, smoke conditions can change quickly over short  distances and can vary considerably hour-by-hour. \nWildfire smoke is a natural part of our environment but it is important to be mindful that exposure to smoke may affect your health. \nPeople with pre-existing health conditions, the elderly, pregnant women and infants, children, and sensitive individuals are more likely to experience health effects from smoke exposure.\n\nDuring smoky conditions:\nFollow your common sense\n-Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes difficult or you \tfeel unwell.\n-Stay cool and drink plenty of fluids.\n-Carry any rescue medications with you at all times.\n-Make sure that children and others who cannot care for themselves follow \tthe same advice. Monitor your symptoms\n-Different people have different responses to smoke. Mild irritation and \t\tdiscomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears.\n-People with asthma or other chronic illness should activate the personal \tcare plans they have designed with their family physicians.\n-If you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC at\t8-1-1.\n-If you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or \t    discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your health care provider,   walk-in clinic, or emergency department.If you are having a         medical emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\nTips to reduce your exposure:\n-Smoke levels may be lower indoors but will still be elevated, so stay     aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.\n-Running a commercially available HEPA (high efficiency particulate air)   filter can improve indoor air quality in the room where the device is     located.\n-If you have a forced air heating/cooling system in your home, it may      help to change the filter and set the fan to run continuously.\n-Reduce indoor air pollution sources such as smoking, burning incense,     and frying foods.\n-Consider going to a library, community center, or shopping mall with      cooler filtered air to get some relief from the smoke.\n-If travelling in a car with air conditioning, keep the windows up and     the ventilation set to recirculate.\n-If you are very sensitive to smoke, consider moving to another location   with cleaner air, but be aware that conditions can change rapidly.\n-Maintaining good overall health is a good way to prevent health effects   resulting from short-term exposure to air pollution.\n\nMore information:\n-For general information about wildfire smoke and your health, contact     HealthLinkBC:Phone 8-1-1 (toll free, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week), or   Check the Wildfires and Your Health webpage at                            https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-feature/wildfires.\n-The current Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and other air quality         information is available at the BC Air Quality website,                   http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/bcairquality/readings/aqhi-table.xml.\n-Forecasts of smoke levels over the next 48 hours are available from the   Environment and Climate Change Canada FireWork prediction system,         https://weather.gc.ca/firework/indexe.html\n-If you need to work outdoors in smoky conditions, material can be found   at theWorkSafe  BC  Wildfire  FAQ  website,                              https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/information-sheets/wildfire-smoke-frequently-asked-questions-faq.‚Ä¢First Nations Health Authority: http://www.fnha.ca/what-we-do/environmental-health/wildfire-information\n-Interior Health Authority:  For resources related to forest fire smoke    exposure, airquality, food safety when the power is out and ensuring      your drinking water is safevisit http://www.interiorhealth.ca             (Environment Tab/Emergency Information).\n\nContact information:\nMedia and public inquiries regarding air quality and this bulletin:\nEarle Plain, Air Quality Meteorologist, Ministry of Environment & Climate Change Strat-egy, 250-616-6516.\n\nMedia questions regarding health implications of wildfires:\nFirst Nations Health Authority Environmental Public Health Services or Main FNHA Line: 604-693-6500\nAfter Hours: 1-844-666-0711 \nEmail: Ephs.afterhours@fnha.ca\nMedia line: 604-831-4898\n\nFraser Health AuthorityMedia Line: 604-831-4898\n\nInterior Health Authority Media line: 1-844-469-7077\nEmail: media@interiorhealth.ca\n\nNorthern Health AuthorityMedia Line: 1-877-961-7724\n\nVancouver Coastal Health Authority Tiffany Akins, Communications Leader: tiffany.akins@vch.ca \nAfter-hours media line: 604-202-2012\n\nVancouver Island Health Authority Meribeth Burton, Media Relations: 250-519-1815\nAfter-hours media line: 250-716-7750\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-29T11:07:41-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.

Wind gusts to 60 km/h were reported in Maine with this thunderstorm. There is a potential for this thunderstorm to become severe with wind gusts reaching 90 km/h briefly as the storm moves through from southwest to northeast.\n\nIn addition, there is potential for additional thunderstorms to develop throughout northwestern New Brunswick later this afternoon, some of which could become severe. Small hail is also possible with these storms.\n\n###\n\nIntense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Daytime highs over inland areas of mainland Nova Scotia are expected to reach 30 C on Monday and possibly 31 C on Tuesday, with overnight lows on Monday night near 18 C providing very little relief. Temperatures across the province should cool down somewhat early on Thursday as a trough of low pressure moves in from the northwest.\n\n###\n\nThe risks are greater for young children, pregnant women, older adults, people with chronic illnesses and people working or exercising outdoors.\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nInformation is provided on the Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness website at https://novascotia.ca/heat-related-illness/.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
