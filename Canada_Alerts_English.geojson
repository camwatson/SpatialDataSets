				"Summary" : "Description: Humidex values reaching 42 are expected for the next 4 days.\n\nA hot and humid tropical air mass will affect Southwestern Ontario beginning Friday.\n\nThe heat and humidity will last through the weekend to at least Monday.\n\nAfternoon temperatures will reach the low to mid thirties. Humidex values will reach the low forties each afternoon. Temperatures overnight will remain in the low to mid twenties, providing little relief from the heat. \n\nHot and humid air can also bring deteriorating air quality and can result in the Air Quality Health Index to approach the high risk category.\n\nSlightly cooler and less humid conditions may arrive on Tuesday.\n\n###\n\nWatch for the effects of heat illness: swelling, rash, cramps, fainting, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and the worsening of some health conditions.\n\nHeat warnings are issued when very high temperature or humidity conditions are expected to pose an elevated risk of heat illnesses, such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
