				"Summary" : "Description: A strong weather disturbance will bring highly variable weather conditions to southern Manitoba Thursday night through Saturday.\n\nA large change in the weather is on the way for southern Manitoba tonight. An approaching low pressure system will begin spreading warmer air into the region, sending temperatures climbing through the night. Southeasterly winds will also develop tonight, though, increasing to 30 gusting 50 km/h and producing wind chills in the -35 to -40 range through the evening hours. Wind chill values will moderate through the second half of the night as temperatures continue to climb.\n\nWhile most of the province will see considerably warmer temperatures on Friday than will be seen on Thursday, the warmest push of air will move through the Red River Valley and southeastern corner of the province. In these areas, daytime highs will climb to above-seasonal values in the -7 to -10°C range (potentially as much as 15°C warmer than seen on Thursday).\n\nThe relief from the cold will be short-lived, however. Conditions will begin to deteriorate on Friday afternoon. Snow will begin spreading into the province from the south, intensifying on Friday evening and through the night. The highest snowfall accumulations on Friday night will occur over the Red River Valley, southern Interlake, and areas eastwards. General accumulations of 5 to 10 cm are forecast, however localized areas of slightly higher amounts may occur.\n\nThrough the night, moderate northwesterly winds will develop, combining with the falling snow to produce areas of reduced visibility in blowing snow. The areas most impacted by blowing snow on Friday night will most likely be southwestern Manitoba into the western Red River Valley.\n\nOn Saturday, light snow will continue through the day across much of southern Manitoba with a further accumulation of 1 to 3 cm. The northwesterly winds will strengthen to 40 gusting 60 km/h as temperatures hover in the low minus teens to -20°C range. The accumulated snow, continuing light snow, and strong winds will produce widespread blowing snow through the day. Winds will gradually ease on Saturday night with improving conditions.\n\nAnybody who has plans to travel on area highways Friday night or Saturday should ensure that they check local weather forecasts (https://weather.gc.ca/forecast/canada/index_e.html?id=mb) regional highway conditions (https://manitoba511.ca/en/) before travelling. Ensure that your vehicle contains a winter emergency kit (https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/sfttps/tp201012-en.aspx) in case poor travelling conditions cause you to be stranded for a period of time. Poor travelling conditions will also develop through the Dakotas and Minnesota, where this system will bring higher snowfall accumulations alongside strong(er) winds.\n\nTemperatures will remain below-seasonal through the remainder of the weekend, but a milder weather pattern is likely to develop next week.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A strong weather disturbance will bring highly variable weather conditions to southern Manitoba Thursday night through Saturday.\n\nA large change in the weather is on the way for southern Manitoba tonight. An approaching low pressure system will begin spreading warmer air into the region, sending temperatures climbing through the night. Southeasterly winds will also develop tonight, though, increasing to 30 gusting 50 km/h and producing wind chills in the -35 to -40 range through the evening hours. Wind chill values will moderate through the second half of the night as temperatures continue to climb.\n\nWhile most of the province will see considerably warmer temperatures on Friday than will be seen on Thursday, the warmest push of air will move through the Red River Valley and southeastern corner of the province. In these areas, daytime highs will climb to above-seasonal values in the -7 to -10°C range (potentially as much as 15°C warmer than seen on Thursday).\n\nThe relief from the cold will be short-lived, however. Conditions will begin to deteriorate on Friday afternoon. Snow will begin spreading into the province from the south, intensifying on Friday evening and through the night. The highest snowfall accumulations on Friday night will occur over the Red River Valley, southern Interlake, and areas eastwards. General accumulations of 5 to 10 cm are forecast, however localized areas of slightly higher amounts may occur.\n\nThrough the night, moderate northwesterly winds will develop, combining with the falling snow to produce areas of reduced visibility in blowing snow. The areas most impacted by blowing snow on Friday night will most likely be southwestern Manitoba into the western Red River Valley.\n\nOn Saturday, light snow will continue through the day across much of southern Manitoba with a further accumulation of 1 to 3 cm. The northwesterly winds will strengthen to 40 gusting 60 km/h as temperatures hover in the low minus teens to -20°C range. The accumulated snow, continuing light snow, and strong winds will produce widespread blowing snow through the day. Winds will gradually ease on Saturday night with improving conditions.\n\nAnybody who has plans to travel on area highways Friday night or Saturday should ensure that they check local weather forecasts (https://weather.gc.ca/forecast/canada/index_e.html?id=mb) regional highway conditions (https://manitoba511.ca/en/) before travelling. Ensure that your vehicle contains a winter emergency kit (https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/sfttps/tp201012-en.aspx) in case poor travelling conditions cause you to be stranded for a period of time. Poor travelling conditions will also develop through the Dakotas and Minnesota, where this system will bring higher snowfall accumulations alongside strong(er) winds.\n\nTemperatures will remain below-seasonal through the remainder of the weekend, but a milder weather pattern is likely to develop next week.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-01-17T10:57:18-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-01-16T18:58:18-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0363868536.2020<br>Area: Lake Winnipeg - north basin, Lake Winnipeg - south basin, Lake Manitoba",

Flooding and damage to coastal infrastructure are possible, especially in locations exposed to the north. Highest water levels are expected near high tide Friday night and early Saturday afternoon.\n\n###\n\nHigh waves combined with the surge may cause damage along the coast. Coastal erosion is possible in vulnerable areas.\n\nStorm surge warnings are issued when water levels pose a threat to coastal regions.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The combination of snow and strong winds will create blizzard conditions with visibilities reduced to near zero in blowing snow.\n\nConditions are expected to improve early on Saturday for most areas but strong winds, snow and blowing snow will persist over coastal areas exposed to the north into Saturday afternoon.\n\nDamage to buildings, such as to roof shingles and windows, may occur. Store or anchor objects so they are not tossed by the wind causing injury or damage.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be extremely hazardous due to reduced visibility.\n\nBlizzard warnings are issued when widespread reduced visibilities of 400 metres or less are expected for at least 4 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Once it returns, extreme cold will likely persist through the weekend.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nWatch for cold related symptoms: shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle pain and weakness, numbness and colour change in fingers and toes.\n\nFor more information on cold and your health, visit Manitoba Health at https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/cold.html or call Health Links - Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
