Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.<br>Expires: 2020-07-24T02:11:11-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-23T23:36:11-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0479212483.2020<br>Area: Wheatland Co. near Rockyford and Rosebud, Rocky View Co. near Irricana Beiseker and Kathyrn, Rocky View Co. near Chestermere Dalroy and Dalemead, Wheatland Co. near Strathmore Lyalta and Carseland",

Loonie-sized hail has been reported with these storms.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Large hail can damage property and cause injury. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Intense lightning is likely with any thunderstorm that develops. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2020-07-24T00:49:38-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-23T22:52:38-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1118532727.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Grahamdale incl.
