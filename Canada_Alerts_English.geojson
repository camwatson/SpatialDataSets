Under the snow squall bands, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow, and snow will quickly accumulate.\n\nTotal snowfall: locally 15 cm or more in snow squalls.\n\nMaximum wind gusts: 60 km/h giving blowing snow over exposed areas.\n\nLocations: western Cape Breton, particularly the Highlands.\n\nTime span: tonight and Monday.\n\nRemarks: Flurries will become more frequent this evening, along with the potential for the development of snow squalls, as cold west to northwest winds settle over the region.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for the formation of bands of snow that could produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter.
