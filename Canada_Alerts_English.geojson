Strong southwesterly winds gusting up to 110 km/h are expected, especially along coastal areas east and south of the low centre..\n\nA special weather statement is in effect for the possibility of flooding from storm surge and waves.\n\n###\n\nThis could result in some damage to docks and breakwaters. Shoreline erosion and wave overwash is expected where winds blow onshore. These winds could break large tree branches resulting in downed utility lines. Some damage to signage and roof shingles may also occur.\n\nA tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds near 65 km/h or more) are expected over parts of the region within 24 hours.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
