Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-28T09:30:10-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-07-27T17:31:10-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0468694553.2019<br>Area: Mackenzie Co. near Bistcho Lake, Mackenzie Co. near Rainbow Lake Zama Lake and Chateh, Mackenzie Co. near Zama City, Mackenzie Co. near Indian Cabins and Steen River, Mackenzie Co. near Meander River and Lutose, Mackenzie Co. near High Level and Bushe River Res., Co. of Northern Lights near Paddle Prairie Smt, Mackenzie Co. near the Caribou Mountains, Mackenzie Co. near Fort Vermilion, Mackenzie Co. near John D'or Prairie and Fox Lake, Mackenzie Co. near La CrÃªte and Buffalo Head Prairie, Mackenzie Co. near the Tallcree and Wadlin Lake Reserves",

Mild irritation and \t\tdiscomfort are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears.\n-People with asthma or other chronic illness should activate the personal \tcare plans they have designed with their family physicians.\n-If you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC at  \t\t8-1-1.\n-If you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or \t          discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your health care provider, \n walk-in clinic, or emergency department.If you are having a medical       emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\nTips to reduce your exposure:\n-Smoke levels may be lower indoors but will still be elevated, so stay     aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.\n-Running a commercially available HEPA (high efficiency particulate air)   filter can improve indoor air quality in the room where the device is     located.\n-If you have a forced air heating/cooling system in your home, it may      help to change the filter and set the fan to run continuously.\n-Reduce indoor air pollution sources such as smoking, burning incense,     and frying foods.\n-Consider going to a library, community center, or shopping mall with      cooler filtered air to get some relief from the smoke.\n-If travelling in a car with air conditioning, keep the windows up and     the ventilation set to recirculate.\n-If you are very sensitive to smoke, consider moving to another location   with cleaner air, but be aware that conditions can change rapidly.\n-Maintaining good overall health is a good way to prevent health effects   resulting from short-term exposure to air pollution.\n\nMore information:\n-For general information about wildfire smoke and your health, contact     HealthLinkBC:Phone 8-1-1 (toll free, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week), or   Check the Wildfires and Your Health webpage at                            https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-feature/wildfires.\n-The current Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) and other air quality         information is available at the BC Air Quality website,                   http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/bcairquality/readings/aqhi-table.xml.\n-Forecasts of smoke levels over the next 48 hours are available from the   Environment and Climate Change Canada FireWork prediction system,         https://weather.gc.ca/firework/indexe.html\n-If you need to work outdoors in smoky conditions, material can be found   at theWorkSafe  BC  Wildfire  FAQ  website,                              https://www.worksafebc.com/en/resources/health-safety/information-sheets/wildfire-smoke-frequently-asked-questions-faq.â¢First Nations Health Authority: http://www.fnha.ca/what-we-do/environmental-health/wildfire-information\n-Interior Health Authority:  For resources related to forest fire smoke    exposure, airquality, food safety when the power is out and ensuring      your drinking water is safevisit http://www.interiorhealth.ca             (Environment Tab/Emergency Information).\n\nContact information:\nMedia and public inquiries regarding air quality and this bulletin:\nEarle Plain, Air Quality Meteorologist, Ministry of Environment & Climate Change Strat-egy, 250-616-6516.\n\nMedia questions regarding health implications of wildfires:\nFirst Nations Health Authority Environmental Public Health Services or Main FNHA Line: 604-693-6500\nAfter Hours: 1-844-666-0711 \nEmail: Ephs.afterhours@fnha.ca\nMedia line: 604-831-4898\n\nFraser Health AuthorityMedia Line: 604-831-4898\n\nInterior Health Authority Media line: 1-844-469-7077\nEmail: media@interiorhealth.ca\n\nNorthern Health AuthorityMedia Line: 1-877-961-7724\n\nVancouver Coastal Health Authority Tiffany Akins, Communications Leader: tiffany.akins@vch.ca \nAfter-hours media line: 604-202-2012\n\nVancouver Island Health Authority Meribeth Burton, Media Relations: 250-519-1815\nAfter-hours media line: 250-716-7750\n\n###\n\nFor more information on current air quality, visit www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/air.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-28T12:47:17-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, the B.C.
