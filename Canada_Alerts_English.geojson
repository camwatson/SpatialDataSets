				"Summary" : "Description: Poor visibility in snow and blowing snow is expected today and this evening.\n\nA low pressure system will move across southern BC today spreading snow to the interior. At the same time, the arctic front will arrive with strong gusty winds and dropping temperatures. These winds are expected to rise late in the morning and remain strong through the afternoon and evening.\n\nThe combination of falling snow with very strong winds will result in blowing snow and poor visibility. The worst conditions are expected through the afternoon and evening. Visibility will improve through the night as snow tapers off and winds ease.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: 5 to 20 cm of snow by this afternoon.\n\nThe low pressure system continues its trek across the south coast this morning. In the wake of the low this afternoon, northeast outflow winds will collide with northwest winds from the Strait of Georgia. Where they meet, a localised band of heavy snow will develop and push through Metro Vancouver this evening for further localised accumulations of 5 cm.\n\nHigher elevations of West Vancouver, North Vancouver and Coquitlam will continue to see snow today with a further 5 to 10 cm.\n\nVancouver, Burnaby and New Westminster will see wet snow mixed with rain. Precipitation type will depend on proximity to the water, elevation, precipitation intensity and wind direction. A further 5 cm is forecast for these cities.\n\nInland sections of Metro Vancouver - SE such as north Surrey and Langley will continue to see snow today with local accumulations of 2 to 4 cm. Southern sections will see rain, at times mixed with snow, as southerly winds keep temperatures above zero.\n\nRichmond, Delta, Tsawwassen and Ladner will continue to see rain today as the southerly winds have been keeping temperatures above freezing.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
