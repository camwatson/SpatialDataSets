The combination of these winds and the current run of mid-amplitude tidal ranges may produce minor breaking sea conditions along the coast near the following localities on the dates and at the times specified (Eastern Standard Time).\n\n\nForillon Park - Gaspé - Percé: 2020-12-01, from 12:00 PM to 04:00 PM.\n\nNew-Carlisle - Chandler: 2020-12-01, from 12:30 PM to 04:30 PM.\n\nAnticosti: 2020-12-01, from 12:00 PM to 04:00 PM.\n\n###\n\nCoastal erosion is possible in vulnerable areas.\n\nStorm surge warnings are issued when water levels pose a threat to coastal regions.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
