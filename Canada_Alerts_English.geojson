				"Summary" : "Description: Dense smoke from forest fires will affect parts of this region today. Showers are expected this afternoon and tonight which may reduce the amount of forest fire smoke. The smoke may return Friday if the forest fires reintensify.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nIf your home is not air-conditioned, be sure the house doesn't get too warm when doors and windows are closed to keep out smoke. Exposure to too much heat can also result in illness.\n\nIn general, wearing a mask is not the best way to protect your health during a smoke event. In fact, masks may lead to a false sense of security, which may encourage increased physical activity and time spent outdoors, meaning increased exposure to smoke. They can also make breathing more difficult.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nDue to the smoky conditions, individuals living in or travelling to the above noted areas are advised to be aware of potential health concerns that can be associated with current air conditions. In these current conditions, even healthy individuals may experience sore eyes, tears, coughing and a runny nose.\n\nIn areas affected by smoke from wildland fires, Manitobans are encouraged to:\n- limit outdoor activity and/or strenuous physical activity; if breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce the activity\n- reduce exposure to smoke by staying indoors or moving to areas with cleaner air, as conditions can vary dramatically by area\n- turn off furnaces and air-conditioning units that may draw smoke indoors\n- keep indoor air cleaner by avoiding smoking or burning other materials \n\nPeople at higher risk include young children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with heart or lung conditions (particularly asthma), and therefore should avoid as much exposure to smoke as possible.\n\nManitobans with health questions or concerns can contact their health-care provider or call Health Links – Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 1-888-315-9257. More information on the health effects of smoke is available at www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/environmentalhealth/smoke.html.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-07-12T01:14:09-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Manitoba Health, 2019-07-11T09:15:09-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2860209526.2019<br>Area: Oxford House and Gods Lake, Red Sucker Lake, Island Lake",

				"Summary" : "Description: Elevated pollution levels are expected or occurring.\n\nAIR QUALITY ADVISORY FOR YUKON\n\nThe office of the Yukon Chief Medical Officer of Health has issued an Air Quality Advisory for all Yukon communities due to high or increasing concentrations of wildfire smoke.\n\nWildfires in Alaska and central Yukon are causing increased concentrations of smoke throughout the territory. Local conditions may also affect the concentration of smoke in each community.  Please note that there is no immediate wildfire threat to any Yukon communities.\n\nSmoke can impact your health if it lingers in your community. Please observe the following recommendations: \n\n- You may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, eye or throat irritation, or shortness of breath. If you are experiencing symptoms, limit outdoor activity and/or strenuous physical activity; if breathing becomes difficult or uncomfortable, stop or reduce the activity.\n\n-\tMake sure you identify and support those who are at increased risk from wildfire smoke.

				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of severe thunderstorms that may be capable of producing strong wind gusts, large hail and heavy rain.\n\nSevere thunderstorms are possible this afternoon and evening.\n\nThese thunderstorms may be capable of producing very strong wind gusts of 100 km/h, heavy downpours and hail. \n\nScattered showers or thunderstorms are possible this morning. However, stronger thunderstorms are expected to develop this afternoon.\n\n###\n\nStrong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to ONstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #ONStorm.\n\nFor more information: http://www.emergencymanagementontario.ca/english/beprepared/beprepared.html.<br>Expires: 2019-07-12T01:44:14-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-11T13:45:14-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2854888369.2019<br>Area: Gatineau, Belleville - Quinte West - Eastern Northumberland County, Cobourg - Colborne - Western Northumberland County, Tamworth - Sydenham - South Frontenac, Stirling - Tweed - Madoc, Kingston - Odessa - Frontenac Islands, Napanee - Consecon, Picton - Sandbanks Park, Merrickville-Wolford - Kemptville, Westport - Charleston Lake, Brockville - Prescott, Gananoque - Mallorytown, Maxville - Alexandria, Cornwall - Lancaster, Winchester - Newington, Morrisburg - Long Sault, Bancroft - Hastings Highlands - Denbigh, Kaladar - Bannockburn - Bon Echo Park, Prescott and Russell, Petawawa - Pembroke - Cobden, Barry's Bay - Killaloe, Renfrew - Arnprior - Calabogie, Smiths Falls - Perth - Eastern Lanark County, Plevna - Sharbot Lake - Western Lanark County, Ottawa North - Kanata - Orléans, Ottawa South - Richmond - Metcalfe",
