This weak rotation is normally not a danger near the ground. However, there is a chance that this rotation could intensify and become a weak landspout tornado.\n\nLandspout tornadoes do not usually cause significant damage but can still be dangerous. They can be strong enough to topple trees, damage roofs or toss debris short distances.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Anne. Thunderstorms are moving northeast at 30 km/h.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Strong wind gusts can toss loose objects, damage weak buildings, break branches off trees and overturn large vehicles. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\n\nSevere thunderstorm warnings are issued when imminent or occurring thunderstorms are likely to produce or are producing one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.<br>Expires: 2019-07-08T23:45:27-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-07-08T21:02:27-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.2841664997.2019<br>Area: R.M. of Macdonald incl.
