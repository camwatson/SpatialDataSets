				"Summary" : "Description: A cold front tracking across western Saskatchewan will make its way eastward tonight. As it passes strong northwesterly winds in excess of 90 km/h together with falling snow will create blizzard conditions with zero visibilities in blowing snow. \n\nConditions are expected to improve over western Saskatchewan towards midnight and south central Saskatchewan overnight. Over southeastern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba  blizzard conditions are expected to improve Thursday morning as the snow diminishes in intensity. However,\nstrong northwesterly winds will persist maintaining blowing snow in the region throughout the day with the blowing snow not ending until Thursday evening.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

As it passes strong northwesterly winds in excess of 90 km/h together with falling snow will create blizzard conditions with zero visibilities in blowing snow. \n\nConditions are expected to improve over western Saskatchewan towards midnight and south central Saskatchewan overnight. Over southeastern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba  blizzard conditions are expected to improve Thursday morning as the snow diminishes in intensity. However,\nstrong northwesterly winds will persist maintaining blowing snow in the region throughout the day with the blowing snow not ending until Thursday evening.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Brief, intense snowfall is expected to develop. Under the snow squall, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow.\n\nBrief squalls of snow and wind are expected over southern Saskatchewan.\n\nSnow squalls, with brief near-zero visibilites in snow and blowing snow, will form in parts of southern Saskatchewan this evening and tonight. While a squall may only last less than an hour, whiteout conditions are likely with any squall that does occur.\n\nThe potential for snow squalls will end overnight.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for brief but intense bursts of heavy snow producing near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Brief, intense snowfall is expected to develop. Under the snow squall, visibilities will be significantly reduced due to the heavy snow.\n\nThe snowsquall watch has been replaced by a blizzard warning for south central and southeastern Saskatchewan. The snowsquall watch remains in effect for the Cypress Hills, Maple Creek and Shaunavon.\n\nBrief squalls of snow and wind are expected over region.\n\nSnow squalls, with brief near-zero visibilites in snow and blowing snow, will form in parts of southwestern Saskatchewan this evening. While a squall may only last less than an hour, whiteout conditions are likely with any squall that does occur.\n\nThe potential for snow squalls will end overnight.\n\n###\n\nTravel may be hazardous due to sudden changes in the weather. Visibility may be significantly and suddenly reduced to near zero.\n\nSnow squall watches are issued when conditions are favourable for brief but intense bursts of heavy snow producing near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
