A changeover to ice pellets and/or freezing rain is expected to occur on Friday, before precipitation changes back to snow on Friday night. Strong easterly winds Friday night into Saturday morning may also cause reduced visibility in snow and blowing snow. The snow is expected to taper off Saturday morning.  \n\nIt is still uncertain where and when the changeover between snow and mixed precipitation will occur, which will affect the amount and location of the heaviest snowfall and the areas most likely to be threatened by freezing rain. Warnings may be issued with future forecasts as the system approaches.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Some inland areas may receive total freezing rain accumulations of 20 mm or more from this event.  \n\nOn Friday evening, strong southwesterly winds are expected to develop across much of the province, particularly along the Atlantic coast and the Bay of Fundy.  It is possible that wind warnings will be issued with future forecasts.\n\nLater on Friday night, winds will diminish and shift to northwesterly as a cold front crossing the province brings snow flurries and a rapid drop to cooler temperatures.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and hazardous. There may be a significant impact on rush hour traffic in urban areas. Ice build-up may cause tree branches to break.

				"Summary" : "Description: Rain, heavy at times is expected. The frozen ground has a reduced ability to absorb this rainfall.\n\nTotal rainfall: 20 to 40 mm, and possibly more in some locations.\n\nLocations: southwestern Nova Scotia.\n\nTime span: early this evening until Friday evening.\n\nRemarks: Snow will begin over southwestern Nova Scotia this morning, changing through ice pellets and freezing rain to rain by early this evening.  Periods of rain will continue, heavy at times, until ending Friday afternoon or evening.  Total rainfall accumulations of 20 to 40 mm are forecast, with the highest amounts expected over Cape Sable Island and vicinity. \n\nFreezing rain warnings have also been issued for this event because inland areas are likely to see a more prolonged period of freezing rain, beginning early this evening and continuing until an approaching warm front causes temperatures rise above freezing overnight tonight.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
