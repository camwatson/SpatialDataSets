The worst conditions will be late overnight and Wednesday morning with near zero visibility in snow and blowing snow. The snow will gradually taper off later on Wednesday allowing visibilities to slowly improve during the late afternoon or evening.\n\nTotal snowfalls of 15 to 20 cm are likely.\n\nRankin Inlet and Chesterfield Inlet will also be impacted by this system, although at this point it appears that the worst conditions will be at Arviat. Please listen for updated watches and warnings as this system moves into the area.\n\n###\n\nTravel is expected to be hazardous due to reduced visibility in some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

At this time it appears much of Newfoundland's interior will see a prolonged wet, heavy snowfall event with gusty northeasterly winds. The highest snowfall accumulations should be in the Island's interior, with more of a mixture of snow and rain the closer you get to the coast. Along Newfoundland's east coast, precipitation will fall mostly as rain.\n\nSome uncertainty still remains with this system, updates will be provided as the scenario becomes more clear.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
