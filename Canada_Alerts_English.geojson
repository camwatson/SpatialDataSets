				"Summary" : "Description: Snow and blowing snow over the weekend...\n\nA low pressure system will track across Southern Quebec and is expected to give 10 to 15 centimetres of snow between Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon.\n\nIn addition, moderate to occasionally strong easterlies will cause blowing snow locally, mainly in exposed areas such as the Saint Lawrence and the Outaouais Valleys.\n\nThe snowfall, reduced visibilities and cold temperatures should make for poor road conditions and difficult travel conditions.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA strong Pacific storm arrives tonight with a mix of wintery weather including snow, freezing rain, and blowing snow.\n\nThe storm will arrive tonight with snow beginning this evening across East and Central Vancouver Island. Total snowfall of 10 to 20 cm is expected by Saturday morning.\n\nStrong winds will also accompany the storm. As a result blowing snow is expected overnight tonight and early Saturday morning.\n\nAs warmer air associated with storm penetrates the region, the snow will likely transition to freezing rain over central Vancouver Island overnight tonight. \n\nA complete change over to rain is expected by Saturday morning for all regions. \n\nTiming this transition from snow to freezing rain is always challenging in these situations. There is a chance that this transition could be delayed resulting in higher snowfall amounts.\n\nStay tuned to the latest Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest warnings and forecasts.\n\n###\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-01-18T16:34:08-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-01-18T00:38:08-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0541947875.2020<br>Area: East Vancouver Island - Duncan to Nanaimo, East Vancouver Island - Nanoose Bay to Fanny Bay, East Vancouver Island - Courtenay to Campbell River, Inland Vancouver Island",
