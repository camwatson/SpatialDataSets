This snow will combine with moderate northeasterly winds to produce areas of poor visibility in snow and blowing snow. Conditions will improve on Saturday night as the winds ease and the snow begins to taper off.\n\nStorm total snowfall amounts are currently forecast to be in the 10 to 15 cm range, however there remains some uncertainty to those amounts at this time. This watch will be updated later today as this system develops over southern Alberta and more certainty is gained in where the heaviest band of snow will track.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow. Poor weather conditions may contribute to transportation delays.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
