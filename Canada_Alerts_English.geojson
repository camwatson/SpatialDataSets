				"Summary" : "Description: Conditions are favourable for the development of dangerous thunderstorms that may be capable of producing damaging wind gusts, damaging hail and torrential rain.\n\nSevere thunderstorms associated with a low pressure system currently in North Dakota are pushing northwards into Canada this evening. Large hail, torrential downpours and damaging wind gusts will be associated with the strongest of these thunderstorms.\n\nThe threat of severe weather will begin to push eastward tonight as the low pressure system evolves.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-07-01T07:59:49-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-07-01T03:53:49-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0929818052.2020<br>Area: R.M. of Elton incl.

Large hail, torrential downpours and damaging wind gusts will be associated with the strongest of these thunderstorms.\n\nThe threat of severe weather will begin to push eastward tonight as the low pressure system evolves.\n\n###\n\nVery large hail can damage property, break windows, dent vehicles and cause serious injury. Very strong wind gusts can damage buildings, down trees and blow large vehicles off the road. Remember, severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads.\n\nSevere thunderstorm watches are issued when atmospheric conditions are favourable for the development of thunderstorms that could produce one or more of the following: large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
