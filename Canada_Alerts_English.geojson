The snow is likely to change to ice pellets or freezing rain on Sunday but will transition back to snow Sunday night. Churchill Falls and Churchill Valley may even see a brief period of rain Sunday evening before changing back to snow.

The frozen ground has a reduced ability to absorb this rainfall.\n\nTotal rainfall: 15 to 30 mm, with locally higher amounts possible inland over higher terrain.\n\nLocations: western Newfoundland.\n\nTime span: Saturday evening until Sunday evening.\n\nRemarks: Rain will be heavy at times, and will occur in conjunction with very mild temperatures. Any existing snow cover will melt quickly and contribute to an elevated risk of flooding, especially near rivers or creeks and in low lying areas.\n\n###\n\nHeavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Localized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
