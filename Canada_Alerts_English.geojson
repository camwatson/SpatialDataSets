				"Summary" : "Description: Wildfire smoke is causing poor air quality and locally reduced visibilities at times.\n\n###\n\nIndividuals may experience symptoms such as increased coughing, throat irritation, headaches or shortness of breath. Children, seniors, and those with cardiovascular or lung disease, such as asthma, are especially at risk.\n\nPeople with lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD, can be particularly sensitive to air pollution. They will generally experience more serious health effects at lower levels. Pollution can aggravate their diseases, leading to increased medication use, doctor and emergency room visits, and hospital visits.\n\nFor more information please visit Alberta Health Services at www.albertahealthservices.ca/news/air.aspx.\n\nVisit www.airhealth.ca for information on how to reduce your health risk and your personal contribution to pollution levels, as well as for current and forecast AQHI values.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-08-02T13:25:16-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada,  Alberta Environment and Parks,  Alberta Health,  Alberta Health Services, 2019-08-01T21:26:16-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1291646911.2019<br>Area: Mackenzie Co. near Bistcho Lake, Mackenzie Co. near Rainbow Lake Zama Lake and Chateh, Mackenzie Co. near Zama City, Mackenzie Co. near Indian Cabins and Steen River, Mackenzie Co. near Meander River and Lutose, Mackenzie Co. near High Level and Bushe River Res., Co. of Northern Lights near Paddle Prairie Smt, Mackenzie Co. near the Caribou Mountains, Mackenzie Co. near Fort Vermilion, Mackenzie Co. near John D'or Prairie and Fox Lake, Mackenzie Co. near La Crête and Buffalo Head Prairie, Mackenzie Co. near the Tallcree and Wadlin Lake Reserves",

				"Summary" : "Description: Early August Heavy Rainfall for Vancouver Island and the South Coast of British Columbia.\n\nAn unseasonably strong Pacific frontal system is poised to drench Vancouver Island and parts of the south coast beginning today. The system will tap into subtropical moisture which will amplify the front and help to enhance the rainfall.\n\nThe main area of rain will begin over west and inland Vancouver Island this morning. The rain will spread across central Vancouver Island and over the Sunshine Coast later this morning and will become heavy at times this afternoon as the front intensifies. \n\nOver Howe Sound, Whistler, and northern sections of Metro Vancouver the main area of rain will arrive later this afternoon and this evening as the front moves southward. \n\nThe continuous rain will end overnight or early Friday morning as the front pushes to the east. In the wake of the front, there will be showers with a risk of thunderstorms and gusty winds through Friday. \n\nStay tuned to Environment and Climate Change Canada for all the latest forecasts.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
