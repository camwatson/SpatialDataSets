				"Summary" : "Description: A period of hot, humid weather ahead for southern Manitoba.\n\nTemperatures will soar for today and Wednesday across southern Manitoba. A warm front pushing into the region will bring a hot, humid air mass into the province. Temperatures will climb above 30°C both days, and humidex values will reach the mid- to upper-30s as the humidity increases.\n\nTonight, a breezy southerly wind combined with the hot and humid air mass will keep temperatures very warm through the night. In the Red River Valley and southeastern Manitoba, temperatures will likely only drop into the low twenties.\n\nA cold front will move through the province on Wednesday night, bringing a return to more seasonal temperatures and humidity.\n\nIn addition to the heat, much of southern Manitoba will see the potential for thunderstorm activity over the coming days. Some of these thunderstorms will likely be severe with a variety of threats. The humid conditions will support very heavy rainfall with some thunderstorms that develop. Areas in southeastern Manitoba affected by recent heavy rains may see more torrential rainfall; on Wednesday, the region could see narrow bands of training thunderstorms resulting in significant rainfall accumulation.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to MBstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #MBStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-06-17T00:56:03-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-06-16T08:57:03-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.3435292981.2020<br>Area: City of Winnipeg, R.M. of Coldwell incl.
