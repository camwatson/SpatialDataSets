Freezing rain ending Sunday evening.\n\nWinds: gusts to 70-80 km/h in the Tantramar Marsh region today. Gusts \nof 40 km/h on Sunday over northern areas.\n\nLocations: Nova Scotia, excluding southwesternmost regions and northern Cape Breton.\n\nRemarks: rain and very mild temperatures associated with brisk southwest winds can be expected today and this evening. Temperatures will fall rapidly overnight tonight over northern areas of the province and over most other areas of the province early on Sunday morning. Rain will change to freezing rain or ice pellets over much of the province by early Sunday morning. These conditions are expected to persist throughout the day Sunday. \n\nSignificant impacts from these changing precipitation types are likely.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Utility outages may occur.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Once again, higher elevations such as West Vancouver, North Vancouver and Coquitlam will see the greatest snow accumulations of up to 15 cm by Sunday afternoon.\n\nVancouver, Burnaby and New Westminster will see wet snow mixed with rain. Precipitation type will depend on proximity to the water, elevation, intensity and wind direction. As a result, lower accumulations of 5 to 10 cm are forecast for these cities.\n\nSome uncertainty remains for Surrey and Langley as southerly winds are forecast to develop overnight which may moderate temperatures and keep precipitation as rain or a mix of rain and snow such that accumulations are reduced.\n\nRichmond, Delta, Tsawwassen and Ladner are more likely to be influenced by the southerly winds tonight, keeping temperatures warm enough to see mostly rain.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Rainfall, combined with melting snow, is expected. The frozen ground has a reduced ability to absorb this rainfall.\n\nA soaker on tap today.\n\nA moisture laden low from Texas is spreading rain across Eastern Ontario today, with most areas receiving a total of 20 to 30 mm by this evening. The rain is then expected to change over to freezing rain this evening as temperatures slide down to the zero degree mark.\n\nSince the ground is frozen, the winter rainfall warning criterion of 25 mm in 24 hours is being met.  \n\nFor information concerning flooding, please consult your local conservation authority or Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry district office.\n\nFreezing rain may last for several hours tonight before becoming mixed with ice pellets or a couple cm of snow Sunday. Significant ice accretion of 10 to 20 mm is possible tonight from the freezing rain. A Freezing rain warning is also in effect.\n\nBrisk northerly winds Sunday are also possible. These winds coupled with ice build up on tree branches and power lines could cause a few power outages. \nWarnings will be issued as the event draws nearer.  \n\nTravel will be impacted throughout Southern Ontario Saturday into Sunday.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
