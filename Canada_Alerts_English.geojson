				"Summary" : "Description: Weekend snowfall is expected.\n\nTotal snowfall: 5 to 10 cm, but potentially approaching 15 cm.\n\nMaximum wind gusts: 40 to 60 km/h possible.\n\nLocations: central and eastern Nova Scotia.\n\nTime span: late this afternoon to early Sunday morning.\n\nRemarks: A developing storm approaching from the southwest is forecast to pass just east of Cape Breton on Sunday morning. Snow associated with the system will spread to all of central and eastern Nova Scotia by this evening and then taper to flurries Sunday morning. Snowfall warnings remain in effect for Antigonish County, Guysborough County, and all of Cape Breton. The latest forecast guidance continues to indicate lesser snowfall accumulations of 5 to 10 cm just to the west of these areas.\n\nHowever, there is still some uncertainty in the track of this system, and a shift to the northwest could increase snowfall amounts over central Nova Scotia.  The forecast will be updated as the system approaches.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: High concentration of pollutants are expected and will result in poor air quality, especially in urban areas where pollutant emissions are higher.\n\nConcentrations of fine particulate matter are high in the Greater Montreal Area and will remain so overnight tonight and Sunday.\n\n###\n\nSmog especially affects asthmatic children and people with respiratory ailments or heart disease. It is therefore recommended that these individuals avoid intense physical activity outdoors until the smog warning is lifted.\n\nIn Quebec, wood heating is the main source of fine particles that contribute to smog during winter. This activity generates the largest number of these particulates, more than industrial activities and transportation.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nTo learn more about the Info-Smog program, go to Environment Canada’s website at www.canada.ca/info-smog-program.\n\nFor air quality indexes in Quebec, visit the website of the Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques at www.iqa.environnement.gouv.qc.ca/contenu/index_en.asp.\n\nFor the air quality index in Montréal, visit the Réseau de surveillance de la qualité de l’air de la Ville de Montréal’s website at www.rsqa.qc.ca (french only).\n\nTo learn more about the effects of smog on your health in Québec, visit the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux’s website at www.quebec.ca/en/health.

				"Summary" : "Description: Brief, intense snowfall is expected. Visibilities will be rapidly reduced due to the heavy snow combined with blowing snow.\n\nA line of snow squalls from just south of Calgary to Brooks to just north of Medicine hat is travelling southwards.  It is expected to reach Medicine Hat shortly before 1AM, and Lethbridge shortly before 2AM.  The snowsqualls should move out of the area early in the morning.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nSnow squall warnings are issued when bands of snow form that produce intense accumulating snow or near zero visibilities.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Snowfall accumulations of near 15 cm are expected by early Sunday evening before the snow begins to mix with or change briefly to rain.  Rain is expected to be most significant in the south, where the Burin Peninsula could see 10 to 20 mm by the time precipitation tapers Sunday evening.  Some localized flooding is possible in that area due to existing snow pack.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nSnowfall warnings are issued when significant snowfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
