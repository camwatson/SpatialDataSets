Precipitation type will depend on proximity to the water, elevation, intensity and wind direction. As a result, lower accumulations of 5 to 10 cm are forecast for these cities.\n\nSome uncertainty remains for Surrey and Langley as southerly winds are forecast to develop overnight which may moderate temperatures and keep precipitation as rain or a mix of rain and snow such that accumulations are reduced. However, over the northern sections near Fraser Height, snow accumulations near 5 cm are possible.\n\nRichmond, Delta, Tsawwassen and Ladner are more likely to be influenced by the southerly winds tonight, keeping temperatures warm enough to see mostly rain.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The frozen ground has a reduced ability to absorb this rainfall.\n\nRain will continue into this evening with total rainfall amounts of 40 to 60 mm  expected by midnight.\n\nSince the ground is frozen, the winter rainfall warning criterion of 25 mm in 24 hours is being met.  \n\nFor information concerning flooding, please consult your local conservation authority or Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry district office. \n\nThe rain will change over to freezing rain in most areas beginning later this evening as temperatures dip to near the zero degree mark. Freezing rain warnings are in effect for areas just north and east of Toronto, and may be extended into areas from Toronto and west tonight as needed. \n\nBrisk northwest winds gusting up to 60 km/h will herald the end of the precipitation Sunday morning.\n\n###\n\nLocalized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.\n\nRainfall warnings are issued when significant rainfall is expected.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
