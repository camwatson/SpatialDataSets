Very strong southwesterly winds will develop this evening, and this combined with the heavy coating of ice on many trees could lead to downed branches and power outages. Temperature will fall rapidly again overnight as winds shift to northwesterly then gradually diminish on Saturday.\n\n###\n\nSurfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots will become icy, slippery and extremely hazardous.\n\nFreezing rain warnings are issued when rain falling in sub-zero temperatures creates ice build-up and icy surfaces.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
