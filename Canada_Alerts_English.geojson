				"Summary" : "Description: Significant winter storm expected Friday into Saturday.\n\nLocations: northeastern Newfoundland and the Burin Peninsula.\n\nTotal snowfall: 15 to 30 cm with locally higher amounts possible.\n\nMaximum wind gusts: northerly 90 to 110 km/h inland, with gusts to 120 to 130 km/h along exposed areas of the coast.\n\nStorm surge: Higher than normal water levels along the east and northeast coasts due to 60 to 80 cm of storm surge combined with 7 to 10 m waves. Flooding and damage to coastal infrastructure is possible, especially in communities exposed to the north. Highest water levels are expected near high tide Friday night and early Saturday afternoon. \n\nTime span: Friday morning until Saturday morning.\n\nRemarks: An intense storm will affect the island through the day Friday into Saturday. Anyone planning travel or other weather-sensitive activities is urged to monitor forecasts and to consider alternate plans. Visibility is expected to be reduced to near zero over some areas, with blizzard conditions possible. \n\nConditions are expected to improve early on Saturday for some areas but strong winds, snow and blowing snow will persist over coastal areas in the northeast until midday.\n\n###\n\nWinter storm watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

Flooding and damage to coastal infrastructure is possible, especially in communities exposed to the north. Highest water levels are expected near high tide Friday night and early Saturday afternoon. \n\nTime span: early Friday morning until Saturday morning.\n\nRemarks: An intense storm will affect the island through the day Friday into Saturday. Anyone planning travel or other weather-sensitive activities is urged to monitor forecasts and to consider alternate plans. Visibility is expected to be reduced to near zero over some areas, with blizzard conditions anticipated.  \n\nConditions are expected to improve through the morning on Saturday.\n\n###\n\nWinter storm watches are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: A prolonged period of very cold wind chills is expected.\n\nA cold, arctic air mass is entrenched over southern Saskatchewan.\n\nExtreme cold wind chill values of -40 to -50 will continue tonight.\n\nThe extreme wind chill values will ease on Thursday as a passing low brings warmer temperatures to the region, but the cold will return on Friday night as more Arctic air spills southeastwards across the region. Once it returns, extreme cold will likely persist through the weekend.\n\n###\n\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk.\n\nWatch for cold related symptoms: shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle pain and weakness, numbness and colour change in fingers and toes.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nWind chill values below minus 20, blowing snow, a potential of freezing rain and more snow are expected.\n\nAn Arctic ridge of high pressure over the BC Interior combined with a low pressure system approaching the BC Coast will produce strong outflow winds through the Fraser Valley. The winds combined with cold temperatures will produce wind chill values of minus 20 or colder today.\n\nThe strong outflow winds combined with periods of snow, and plenty of snow on ground, will will significantly reduce visibility over parts of the Fraser Valley today and tonight.\n\nThe approaching low offshore will produce a layer of warm air above the surface. This layer of warm air combined with freezing temperatures at the surface will give potential for freezing rain to develop tonight.\n\nIn addition, the low approaches the coast, 10 cm of snow is expected over western sections of the Fraser Valley on Thursday.\n\n###\n\nVisibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nWinter storm warnings are issued when multiple types of severe winter weather are expected to occur together.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-01-16T12:11:46-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-01-15T20:12:46-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.1325261719.2020<br>Area: Fraser Valley - west including Abbotsford, Fraser Valley - central including Chilliwack, Fraser Valley - east including Hope",
