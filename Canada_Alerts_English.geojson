In addition, sudden near zero visibility from blowing snow and bursts of heavy snow are expected as the snow squall moves in.\n\nThe snow squall will move south of the area this afternoon. However new snow squalls are expected to develop off of Southern Lake Huron later this afternoon when the winds shift to a more northerly direction. These will affect Eastern Lambton County and Middlesex County mainly west of the City of London.\n\n###\n\nSnow squalls cause weather conditions to vary considerably; changes from clear skies to heavy snow within just a few kilometres are common.
