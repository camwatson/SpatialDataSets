				"Summary" : "Description: Hazardous winter conditions are expected.\n\nA Pacific frontal system will remain stationary over the north coast this morning. Consequently, heavy snow will continue this morning. Total snowfall accumulations of up to 50 cm are expected. In addition, there is a risk of freezing rain as warmer air moves in aloft. The snow mixed with freezing rain will finally end near noon as the front moves to the east.\n\n###\n\nVisibility may be suddenly reduced at times in heavy snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@canada.ca or tweet reports using #BCStorm.<br>Expires: 2020-01-21T03:01:09-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2020-01-20T13:20:09-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.4255605748.2020<br>Area: North Coast - inland including Terrace, North Coast - inland including Kitimat",
