				"Summary" : "Description: For Tropical Depression Six.\n\nThe next information statement will be issued by 03:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nTropical Depression Six expected to become Tropical Storm Erin later today or tonight. Erin is then expected to begin tracking northeastward toward Atlantic Canada on Wednesday, likely bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to parts of the Maritimes later Thursday or Friday. \n\n1. Summary of basic information at 09:00 a.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: Near 31.2 North 71.7 West.\n\nAbout distance 575 kilometres southeast of Cape Hatteras NC.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 55 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: Southeast at 4 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 1010 millibars.\n\n2. Public weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nWith Tropical Depression Six still over 1500 km and several days away from the region, details on impacts for Atlantic Canada can only be generalised at this time. Most of the impacts will depend greatly on the exact track the system takes through our region, which at this time is expected to be near the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia Friday afternoon.\n\na. Wind.\n\nStrong and gusty winds will likely accompany the system, especially to the right of and near the eventual track it takes through our region. At this time it is unlikely that winds will reach warning criteria in the region (i.e. gusts to 90 km/h or higher), but could still be strong enough to cause isolated power outages and minor damage, especially given trees are still in full leaf.\n\nb. Rainfall.\n\nGiven the current forecast track, the greatest impact from this system will be rainfall, which could meet or exceed warning criteria (50 mm or more in 24 hours) in many parts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and southeastern New Brunswick. Maximum rainfall could locally exceed 100 mm in some isolated parts of these regions. Details will become more clear in the coming days as the system becomes better defined and draws nearer to our region.\n\nc. Surge/Waves.\n\nAt this time, given the expected intensity and track of the system, significant storm surge and coastal impacts from high waves are not very likely. However, some higher than normal water levels and high surf are possible near and to the right of the track, and this will be monitored closely as the system evolves over the coming days. \n\n3. Marine weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nGale warnings will likely be required for waters near and adjacent to the track Erin takes through our region later on Thursday and Friday.  Based on the current forecast intensity, storm force winds are not expected at this time.\n\nForecaster(s): Mercer/Borgel\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-08-28T17:38:16-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-08-27T11:39:16-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0908965725.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Fundy National Park, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I.",

				"Summary" : "Description: For Tropical Storm Erin.\n\nThe next information statement will be issued by 03:00 p.m. ADT.\n\nTropical Storm Erin will begin tracking northeastward toward the Maritimes later today. Erin is expected to transition to a post-tropical storm well before it reaches the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia early Friday morning. Erin will bring heavy rain to much of the region beginning Thursday and strong, gusty winds with its passage Thursday night into Friday.\n\n1. Summary of basic information at 09:00 a.m. ADT.\n\nLocation: Near 33.0 North 72.7 West.\n\nAbout distance 363 kilometres southeast of Cape Hatteras NC.\n\nMaximum sustained winds: 65 kilometres per hour.\n\nPresent movement: North-northwest at 9 kilometres per hour.\n\nMinimum central pressure: 1004 millibars.\n\n2. Public weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nTropical Storm Erin is expected to transition to a post-tropical system by the time it enters Canadian waters on Thursday. Rain associated with a trough of low pressure approaching from the west will spread over the western Maritimes early Thursday morning. As Erin approaches later on Thursday, some of its moisture will feed into this trough and likely enhance the rain intensity associated with it. The heavier rain and strongest winds associated directly with post-tropical Erin should reach the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia later Thursday evening. \n\na. Wind.\n\nSome gusty winds will likely accompany post-tropical Erin, especially to those areas just to the right of its track early Friday morning. At this time it is not expected that these winds will reach warning criteria (i.e. gusts to 90 km/h or higher), but could still be strong enough to cause isolated power outages and minor damage, especially given that trees are still in full leaf.\n\nb. Rainfall.\n\nThe combination of Post-Tropical Erin and its interaction with the trough of low pressure crossing the region on Thursday will combine to produce significant rainfall.  Rainfall will likely meet or exceed warning criteria (50 mm or more in 24 hours) in parts of the Maritimes, especially those areas just north and west of Erin's track. Some isolated locations in these areas could possibly see total rainfall amounts in excess of 100 mm before the rain ends later Friday morning\n\nc. Surge/Waves.\n\nAt this time, significant storm surge and coastal impacts from high waves are not expected. However, some higher than normal water levels and high surf are possible near and to the right of the Erin's track where it is expected to cross the Atlantic Coast of Nova Scotia on Friday. \n\n3. Marine weather impacts and warnings summary.\n\nGale warnings have been issued for the southwestern Maritimes marine waters, where gale force southerlies up to 40 knots are expected by Thursday evening.  These gale warnings will likely be extended to adjacent marine areas for Friday near and along Erin's path through Canadian waters.\n\nForecaster(s): Mercer/Borgel\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.<br>Expires: 2019-08-29T17:31:53-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2019-08-28T11:32:53-00:00, urn:oid:2.49.0.1.124.0818314749.2019<br>Area: Kings County, Annapolis County, Digby County, Lunenburg County, Queens County, Shelburne County, Yarmouth County, Cumberland County - Minas Shore, Cumberland County North and Cobequid Pass, Colchester County - Cobequid Bay, Colchester County North, Hants County, Colchester County - Truro and south, Halifax Metro and Halifax County West, Halifax County - east of Porters Lake, Pictou County, Guysborough County, Antigonish County, Richmond County, Inverness County - south of Mabou, Inverness County - Mabou and north, Victoria County, Sydney Metro and Cape Breton County, Grand Lake and Queens County, Sussex - Kennebecasis Valley and Kings County, Saint John and County, St. Stephen and Northern Charlotte County, Grand Manan and Coastal Charlotte County, Kent County, Moncton and Southeast New Brunswick, Kouchibouguac National Park, Fundy National Park, Kings County P.E.I., Queens County P.E.I., Prince County P.E.I.",
