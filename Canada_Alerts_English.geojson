				"Summary" : "Description: Today's heavy rainfall is the first storm in a week-long series that brings a major pattern change to the province of BC, in particular the south coast. Periods of rain, heavy at times, will continue through Saturday. Embedded thunderstorms and gusty winds are possible.\n\nThis sudden change to a prolonged wet pattern combined with local gusty winds and trees shedding their leaves may lead to localized flooding. Strong winds may also lead to power outages.\n\nLate this week the pattern is intensified once again by a strong low pressure system crossing Vancouver Island Thursday night or Friday. Strong winds, and where they materialize, will depend on the exact storm track. Stay tuned to your local forecast throughout the week as we follow the evolution of this feature.\n\n###\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
