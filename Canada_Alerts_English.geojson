				"Summary" : "Description: Arctic air entrenched in the central interior combined with a Pacific warm front delivering warm moist air aloft will produce a wintry mix today and Tuesday.\n\nFreezing rain or ice pellets will develop over the central interior this afternoon and spread south this evening to include the South Thompson region and southwest interior highways. Freezing rain and ice pellets are forecast to change to rain or showers Tuesday afternoon as the warm air reaches the surface and brings the temperature above zero.\n\nFreezing rain may spread to the northeast including the B.C. Peace River, Pine pass and McGregor this evening and last through Tuesday morning.\n\nOver the Bulkley Valley region including Smithers, snow or ice pellets will develop near noon. The potential for freezing rain will depend on the position of the warm front and the strength of the warm air aloft.\n\n###\n\nWeather in the mountains can change suddenly resulting in hazardous driving conditions.\n\nRoad conditions are available at www.drivebc.ca.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.

The highest rainfall totals will most likely fall over higher elevation.  Rain and warm temperatures will combine to cause significant snow melt to the existing snow pack.  However, snow depth is still relatively marginal at this point of the season.

It will intensify this evening and persist during the day on Tuesday as it reaches Eastern portions of the province. In addition, strong northeasterly winds combined with the snow will give widespread blowing snow tonight and Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Tuesday morning commute is expected to be particularly difficult.  Central Quebec is expected to see 15 to 25 centimetres of snow.\n\n###\n\nRapidly accumulating snow could make travel difficult over some locations. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\n\nPlease continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada.
