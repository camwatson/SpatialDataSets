foothills towards Hinton. As the low moves east this evening the cold front will slide south along the Rocky Mountains and generate snowfall accumulations of 5 to 10 centimetres. Embedded heavy flurries along and behind the cold front will generate locally higher accumulations of 15 centimetres and could rapidly reduce visibilities to less than 500 metres. The heavy snow will end Thursday morning in Jasper and by Friday morning in Pincher Creek.<br>Expires: 2014-03-20T19:50:00-00:00<br>Originated from CAP Alert: Environment Canada, 2014-03-20T03:50:00-00:00, 2.49.0.1.124.86473cc6.2014<br>Area: Banff National Park, Kananaskis - Canmore, Jasper National Park, Nordegg - Forestry Trunk Road Highway 734, Rocky Mountain House - Caroline, Crowsnest Pass - Pincher Creek - Waterton Lakes Nat.
